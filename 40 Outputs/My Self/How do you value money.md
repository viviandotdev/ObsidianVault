- I want to spend as little time thinking about money as possible.
- I want to build apps not to make a lot of money but because I enjoy it. I'm lucky to have found something I'm good at and enjoy, so why not spend more time doing it?
- The goal is to continue building apps that I think are cool and that others will use. Salaries and money are byproducts of ambition, not the primary desire.
- It's not that I don't care; I just don't want to fight. I know how things will be, and I'll end up getting hurt, so I give up and let you win. I'm scared of making you upset and will do anything to prevent that.
- I usually don't spend much money
