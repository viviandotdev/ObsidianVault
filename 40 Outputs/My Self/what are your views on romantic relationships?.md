## what are your views on romantic relationships?

**what is love to you?**
Love is caring about someone despite their flaws, I don’t think it is a special feeling
You love your family members and will consistently choose them despite the flaws. It makes it very difficult to let go of family members.

**do you care more to be loved or loved?**


**why i don't want a relationship**
- I don't like all the expectation of being in a relationship, 
- Approaching me and being so forward about liking me when I just met someone, I think feels kind of weird
- Dating apps are weird because what do you mean I'm supposed to know if I am romantically attracted to someone based on a picture and some questions?
- I don't like the idea of someone liking me because they are physically attracted to me, I want to be liked for the way we make each other feel.
	- They should make me feel secure and calm
- I feels like they want to take something from me,

**why have you never been in a relationship?**
I don’t really think about it
But something I think about thinking that that I should think about it
But then I realize that it’s not that interesting for me to think about so I think about something else if that makes sense?

I don’t if it is normal but there’s no way people wake up everyday worried that they don’t have someone?
It bothers me not because it bothers me but because I feel like it bothers the 

Women, have talents, ambitions and beauty Im so sick of people saying that love is all a women is fit for

I think that as a girl in a society all I’ve been told is that I’m supposed to fall in love,
That’s what I see in the movies, that’s what my parents want for me,
Thats what I was taught in school, to get a job so that I can start a family and raise my children and teach them the same things
