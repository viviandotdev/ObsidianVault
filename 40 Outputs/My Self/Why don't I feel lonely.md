# Why don't I feel lonely?

- I have felt more lonely around other people than when I'm alone.
- The most lonely period of my life was high school.
- I never get bored because I have so many questions, books I want to read, and things I want to build and learn. I get confused when people say they are bored.
- The immense computational power and energy required to develop semi-intelligent systems like ChatGPT are staggering. Yet, our brains naturally possess incredible cognitive capabilities, which we often take for granted. Instead of harnessing this potential, many people spend their time mindlessly scrolling through TikTok or watching TV, allowing their brains to atrophy rather than using them to their fullest extent.
