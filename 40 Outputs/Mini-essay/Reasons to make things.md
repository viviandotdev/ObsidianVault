	- When making new things there are thousands of decisions that need to made to create a good product
	- If you make all the "correct" decisions you will make something good

	- Newton was driven by curiosity and ambition, **he did not even think about the practical effects of his work**, yet the effect of his work on the world has been critical
- I'm the only person in the world with my unique experiences, so **if there is something within you that you are capable of producing it deserves to be created because you are the only person who can and will ever create it**.
- **Make something so you can put it back into the pool of human experience**


- The value in art is not how many people see it, **the value comes from how many people couldn't have created what you can**.

- The regret and pain you feel form not achieving your dreams is greater than the pain you feel from doing the hard work now
