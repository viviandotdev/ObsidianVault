## Investing life energy into controllable aspects, such as personal interests and goals, is a smarter choice than pursuing a relationship, which is not entirely within your control.

If a relationship happens along the way while pursuing your interests, that's great. If not, you haven't wasted your time, as you've continued to do what you enjoy and grow as an individual. 
By investing time and energy into building something admirable, you become a person that others will naturally be drawn to.
