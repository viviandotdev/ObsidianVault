2. Anything in your inbox you are articles you have not read it, yet
3. After you read and process it
4.  If it is not interesting to you, nothing here resonates and is worth creating a note for, just delete
	Else mark it as 1 indicating you want to write notes about it and then add relevant search tags to find it easily later
