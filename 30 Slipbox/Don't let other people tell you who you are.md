## Don't let other people tell you who you are


**Don't let other people tell you who you are. The person that lives with you 24/7 is you so donâ€™t let people tell you who you are you are the only person who knows yourself best.**


Trust your own understanding of yourself and not let others define you. You know yourself better than anyone else.
