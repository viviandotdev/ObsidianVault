## why you should create content?

There are people in the world who need to hear you say the thing in your words, something about the way you say it and the way you explain it may make them understand it.
Therefore you are doing a diservice by not sharing your understandings with the world because those people will never to able to read it and gain understanding from it as well.

For example when reading the millionaire fastlane, because of his sepcificway of wrting and it motivated me to create and build something. However this is knowledge that I kinda already knew and is i guess common sense. 
When he said that ideas and opportunities are everywere, there are just better this and better that, that is something thata clicked, however i heard this phrase ideas are everywhere before but the way he said it had an impact on me.
