note status (seedling, budding or atomic)
tags
pre read outline creation of main ideas
	what chapters do you find most interesting?, read them first

**while reading**
highlights ideas interesting and creating atomic notes, connecting them
	this note is summarizes the author's idea in my own wods,
	reprase the idea that caught my attenion. the title is the content of the note, 1 -3 sentences atomic idea, no title needed
	

**Example**
Parker asserts that exclusion is critical to an effective gathering, flying in the face of the familiar “the more, the merrier” mentality. Strategy, she argues, requires exclusion. Being able to say “No” to certain attendees means we’ve hit upon a truly strategic purpose for a gathering.

**Source:** The Art of Gathering
**Domain(s):** Adaptive Strategy, Diversity. Inclusion
**Note Type:** Reading

**Date Created:**
**Motive:** Having spent thirteen years in a corporate culture that spotlights inclusion and diversity, this statement initially raised my hackles. But after recalling the wisdom of another statement related to exclusion and strategy (“If you aren’t saying no to some opportunities, you don’t have a strategy”), I could see Parker’s point: if your gathering is important enough to hold, then its purpose is worth defending … and that may mean excluding some people whose presence doesn’t support that purpose.

**Rediscovery:** When creating a guest list, when planning meetings for [[Facilitation]], when planning my own events or parties, when in discussions about [[Diversity]] and the impact of the “everyone deserves a place at the table” philosophy.


rename highlight note to tittle- highlights
book note is title by author
 "thinking notes", another type of atomic note, sometimes you get insights from the authors ideas,

**How will i apply this information?**
For each book you are reading create an ongoing note in obsidian, broken up into the chapter structures of the book and write notes for each chapter
Always have a question and explain to yourself why you are reading this book so you know what to look for in the book and ignore anything that is not interesting
