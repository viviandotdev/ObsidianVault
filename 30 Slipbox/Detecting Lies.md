## Detecting Lies

And we’re terrible at detecting lies, averaging a 54 percent success rate.

Ask lots of open-ended questions that start with **“What” or “How,”** not things that can be answered with one word. You want to be friendly and say just enough to keep ’em gabbing. Letting them monologue makes them feel in control.
If you immediately start challenging what they say, not only might they shut down

Start off with expected questions. This is un-intimidating and gets you info—but more important, it gets you a baseline.
And lead them to say something that contradicts the info you dug up. Ask for clarification so they commit to it. And then: Sorry, I’m confused.
