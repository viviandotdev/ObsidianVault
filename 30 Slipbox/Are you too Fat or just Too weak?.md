## Are you too Fat or just Too weak?

**Summary Note** 
- [[01:05]] 
Highly **insulin resistant**-body has trouble processing carbs.
Low insulin resistant-body can efficiently process carbs
- each 10% increase in skeletal muscle index.
- Insulin resistant reduces by 11%. 
**What does insulin do?**
Insulin takes the glucose and puts in various cells to keep your blood sugar low.
If you are **insulin resistance,** your cells don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up the glucose from your blood into your muscles or liver. This happens when the fat storage in your liver and muscle fill up.

**How do muscles protects your health?**
In order to healthy, you need to be **insulin resistant**, your body should be able to efficiently process carbohydrates.
Muscles absorbs glucose and can dispose of it. The more muscle you have, the more glucose it can absorb and dispose.
The liver can store a little bit, if the liver stores too much glucose, the excess glucose gets turned into fat. 

- [[05:36]] 
Eat more protein to maintain muscle, you cannot each too much protein.

- [[07:20]] 
**Personal fast threshold**:
When we fill up our fat storage in our muscles and liver, the fat goes around your organs, and you become more insulin resistant.

- [[11:11]] 
**How to increase your insulin resistance?**
- Consume at least 1.2 - 1.6 grams of per kilogram of body weight every day, I need 75 grams of protein

- **Resistance exercise**: variations in protein synthesis are greater in a fed that and decline less in the fasted state.It is better to do resistance training in the fed state then in fasted state
