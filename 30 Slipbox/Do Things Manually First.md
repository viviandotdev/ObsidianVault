At the start it is okay to do things manually

Paul worked on a website builder and went to users and asked them if they wanted to use it, they all said too so he proposed what he built it for them using his website store builder and then gave them the site?

From this he learned a lot from manually creating the store using his own builder because he was using he own products and could make fixes as he used it.
