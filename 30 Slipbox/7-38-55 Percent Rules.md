## 7-38-55 Percent Rule


**The 7-38-55 Percent Rule**
7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face. When body language and their words don't align the speaker may be lying or not unconvinced.

Then use labeling to detect why
**For Example:**
you say we agree? but then they response with yes hesitantly.
label what you see:
"i heard you say yes but it seems like there was hesitation in your voice"
them: its nothing
you: this is important and i want to make sure we get this right
