## 7-38-55 Percent Rule


**The 7-38-55 Percent Rule**
7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speakerâ€™s body language and face. When body language and their words don't align the speaker may be lying or not unconvinced.

Then use labeling to detect why
**For Example:**
you say we agree? but then they response with yes hesitantly.
label what you see:
"i heard you say yes but it seems like there was hesitation in your voice"
them: its nothing
you: this is important and i want to make sure we get this right
