### How to overcome procrastination?

**Clarity**
	**Get clarity on uncertain tasks and breaking them down into smaller pieces.**
	If a task is too big and isn't structured well, give it **some structure.**
[[Self Compassion]] is an effective strategy for dealing with task struggles and recognizing that making mistakes is part of the learning process.
- Negative emotions may prompt you to procrastinate. Be kind to oneself and avoiding actions that generate more negative emotions can be helpful in managing procrastination.
- [[Self Compassion]] is recognizing that, you know, to struggle with things as part of a learning process as part of being human
- Often people we start things, and then they realize, oh, it's not going the way I planned, right? And that's when they can abandon it because they made a mistake and the **perfectionism** kicks in and everything. **That's when you need to be self compassionate**. And so self compassion kicks in when we're struggling with our own personal failings, shortcomings, difficult thoughts about ourselves and the task, etc.
