## How I Read Books

### Capture/Highlights
As you read make highlights and notes on important sections
Import all highlights to a cards in Anki


### Review
**Go through the high lights and Filter into 3 buckets**

- **Yes**: I want to convert this note into one or more permanent knowledge items (i.e. Basic or Cloze cards). Mark it and suspend it.
- **No**: I don’t think I’ll ever get value out of this again. Suspend the card.
- **Maybe**: I’m not ready yet to commit to marking or suspending this. Maybe I want to defer the choice, or maybe I just want to see it again every now and then without actually memorizing it.
  

### Integrate

I’ll look at my **marked** cards, convert them into normal cards (Basic or Cloze), and un-mark them and un suspend them. These become integrated knowledge. 
These are the atomic notes you want to review

Highlights will tend to stay relatively fresh when reviewed in this way, and **knowledge integrated into Q&A-style cards becomes permanent.** The underpinning of this system is a commitment to reviewing all due cards in Anki each day, which luckily I do.


 This process basically an [[Incremental Reading]] system,


**Linked References to this Note**
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
