## Linoleic acid

Linoleic acid is an essential (this means that humans cannot produce it, it is obtained through diet) fatty acid 
 - [[Linoleic acid]] makes you dumb; it hogs up space in the brain cells so DHA cannot get in. It shoves out DHA and other fats that are good for your brain.
- Vegetable oil reduces DHA because it has so much linoleic acid.
- Your body needs to balance the amount of linoleic acid and [[Docosahexaenoic acid]](DHA)

Too much linoleic acid can lead to inflammation
