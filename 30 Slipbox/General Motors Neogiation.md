## General Motors Neogiation

  
**Did not go well**
**Could had explained more**
**There were track remote roles**
**Seems like they did not budge at all which sucks**

  

Hi Jenny and Alvin thank you for meeting with me today. I wanted to discuss more about the role as I make my decision,¬†

  

As I mentioned because of my lease for my apartment with nine months remaining I'm not sure if i'll be able to relocate to Milford ,I don‚Äôt know how I would be able to afford paying both my current lease and an apartment in Milford, which makes this a very difficult decision for me,

  

also i just want to apologize for the inconvincen my situation has caused and really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me¬†

‚ÄúAlso I am curious if you had insight on How are roles evaluated¬† and designated as hybrid positions within GM?‚Äù

  

According to the employee handbook employees outside of the 50 miles GM hub radius would be designated as remote,¬†

"i'm asking After speaking with the current TRACK engineer for some insights about what he liked and disliked about the role, while he mentioned he like that this role gave him alot of autonomy over the work he got do do, he also mentioned feeling secluded. I was wondering if I could get some more information of what the day to day in this role will look like and insight on How will onsite collaboration be facilitated in this role to ensure effective teamwork?"

  

in our messages about the role you mentioned¬† React as framework your team uses to build websites, i was wondering if you could elaborate a little more about that project

working on frontend is something that I have always been interested in since durring my own time i enjoy building react components and web¬† applications so it was one of the reasons why i was really excited about this role so if you could go into a littel more details about what that project entails?

  

- I‚Äôm open to alternatives, such as frequent travel to the Milford as needed at my expense at least until my lease has ended.

- I would also be willing to skip my pay raise for my exit role, it it allow to work remotly from my current location

  

ok i will take some time tooday to think about this conversation, thank you so much for both your time¬†

  

I do have a few questions about the voluntary separations

- When I fill out the voluntary separation, is it effective immediately?

- The sprint on my current team ends on feb 12 I would like to wrap up everything I need to do on that team before I initiate my separation is not possible?
