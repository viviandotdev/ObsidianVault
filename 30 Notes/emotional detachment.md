- every time I cried or displayed emotion, **I was punished and yelled at for crying.** This is why **I learned to avoid my emotions and choose to suppress them**. Running away from emotions makes relationships more difficult.
- **fear of abandonment** comes from-
	- early separation from parents, when I was born I was immediately separated from my parents and was sent to china to live with my aunt, 

**how is emotional detachment portrayed?**
-  I don’t get excited about anything or anyone, I am nonchalant about everything
- Crowds are too stimulating and solitude is peaceful
- I am very rational and kind and it seems like I don’t care, but I do understand the emotion, but I try not to feel them too much
- It’s easy to drift away from people I care about not because I don’t love them, but because everything is temporary 
- I keep my distance, neither cold or clingy very measured
