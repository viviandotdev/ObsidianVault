<!--
Define the behaviors that align with this value. These actions will guide you back, when you fall off track. Be sure to include the “why” behind each. -->
I want to put my self in environments where I can be honest with my self. I want to be able to be myself and can act without filtering my actions or words. **I don’t want to be around people that I can’t be fully honest with**
