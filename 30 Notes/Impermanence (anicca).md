## Impermanence (anicca)

The first mark of **existence is impermanence.**
All phenomena, including mental states, material possessions, relationships and life itself, is constantly changing. The stress that often accompanies the loss of the things we cherish diminishes when we accept impermanence. This acceptance grants us the freedom to deeply appreciate our experiences and relationships because we know that they are temporary.
