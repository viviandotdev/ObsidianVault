**Handling Tones**

First, question (1): we're going to expand the image to include the _tone_ for the syllable by refining the _location_:
  Morning, noon, evening, night
1st tone: In front,
2nd tone: Just inside the entrance,
3rd tone: Any other location inside,
4th tone: In the bathroom.

Read the key word and take note of the particular connotation that has been given it. There is only one such meaning, sometimes associated with a colloquial phrase, sometimes with one of the several meanings of the word, sometimes with a well-known cultural phenomenon. Think of that connotation and repeat it to yourself. When you’re sure you’ve got the right one, carry on.

Read through the particular little story that goes with the key word and let the whole picture establish itself clearly.

Now close your eyes, focus on those images in the story that belong to the key word and primitive elements, and let go of the controls. It may take a few seconds, sometimes as long as a minute, but the picture will start to change on its own. The exaggerated focal points will start to take on a life of their own and enhance the image with your own particular experiences and memories. You will know your work is done when you have succeeded in creating a memorable image that is both succinct and complete, both faithful to the original story and yet your very own.

Open your eyes and repeat the key word and primitive elements, keeping that image in mind. This will clear away any fog, and at the same time make sure that when you let go you didn’t let go of the original story, too.

In your mind, juxtapose the elements relative to one another in line with your image or the way they normally appear in the characters.

Take pencil and paper and write the character once, retelling the story as you go.
