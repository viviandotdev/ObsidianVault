## Freedom and flexility over one’s life is the best predictor of wellbeing 
I value freedom and flexibility over my time more that money, when making decisions I consider the time cost as well
**Freedom and flexility over one’s life is the best predictor of wellbeing** - Morgan Housel


People want control with what they do with their lives. The ability to do what you want when you want for however long you want is the key to happiness.
**Freedom and flexility over one’s life is the best predictor of wellbeing**, more than salary and prestige at your job.
The greatest intrinsic of money is that it gives you more **time** and resources to do what you want to do.
