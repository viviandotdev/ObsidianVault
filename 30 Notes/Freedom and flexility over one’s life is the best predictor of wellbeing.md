## Freedom and flexility over one’s life is the best predictor of wellbeing
I value freedom and flexibility over my time more that money, when making decisions I consider the time cost as well
**Freedom and flexility over one’s life is the best predictor of wellbeing** - Morgan Housel

People want control with what they do with their lives. The ability to do what you want when you want for however long you want is the key to happiness.
**Freedom and flexility over one’s life is the best predictor of wellbeing**, more than salary and prestige at your job.
The greatest intrinsic value of [[money]] is that it gives you more **time** and resources to do what you want to do.

**Personal Thought**
- I am willing to take a lower paying job if it offers me more freedom and flexibility
- There is no number that I can put on my flexibility over my time this is something important to me and is more important than my career.
- **[[Time]] is the most valuable resource in the world and too many people waste it.**
- **Time is the great equalizer, regardless of status or wealth everyone is faced with the same finite lifespan and inevitable mortality.**
- I think this is why people are so unhappy when they have no flexibility over their own time, we subconsciously know that we are wasting our life away and it is eating them alive
