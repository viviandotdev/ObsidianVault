## Energy Management

Instead of managing your time, focus on managing your energy, figure out the times in the day where you are most active and fresh, this is one. we should be doing the most important work for the day.
In reality we only have about 2-4 hours per day were are brain can work. at its max capacity, max sure you know when that is and how to use that time correctly
Analytical vs Creative Work
Most important work for me is getting better at building products and programming
My energy is best right after my workout, therefore that is the best time to get a session in my personal project, later in the day I can work on the boring work stuff,
