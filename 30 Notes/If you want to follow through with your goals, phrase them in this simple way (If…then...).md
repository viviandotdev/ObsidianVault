## If you want to follow through with your goals, phrase them in this simple way (If…then...)

If X happens I’ll handle it by doing Y. This is powerful because it activates your non-conscious mind, instead of waiting for problems to arise, it is giving your brain a **habitual** response to act on autopilot.  It reduces your cognitive load on what you need to do next and gives you clarity on how to achieve them.
