## Love is actually misdiagnosed as major depressive episodes by mental health professionals

Symptoms of love sick
- Trouble sleeping
- Can’t focus
- feeling sad
- Lost interest in things you enjoy
- Tired

Loves best resembles OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)
- you can’t control your attention and turn it toward your responsibilities
- people newly in love spend 85% of their waking hours thinking about that special someone
