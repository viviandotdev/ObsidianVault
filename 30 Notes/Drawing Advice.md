I had a cousin who drew beautiful anime like pictures for me everytime I visited her. I would at first trace her pictures, then I just started copying them to the best of my abilities. Then I started **copying other pictures online that I liked and eventually I got the hang of drawing bodies, proportions, faces etc**. of course, I did practice and took art in elementary school like everyone else, but to put it blatantly, I began by copying others that I was inspired by. If youâ€™re feeling stuck, maybe you can give it a try?


I am entirely self-taught, I would say that the most effective method of learning (for me) was master studies. Doesn't matter if they were 1 to 1, value only, or quick compositional studies- all of them were incredibly useful. **The most important thing is knowing what you are trying to study while you are painting, and concentrating on that (i.e, lighting, composition, drapery, palette, value grouping, edge control etc).** I found that this technique work equally well for portraits and landscapes.

Draw the same thing over and over again
Focus on concentrating on one thing
	structure and gesture, blocking in the most simple shapes
Observation
Active Recall

Goal Studio Ghibli,
