## Loss Aversion

We the emotions we perceive from loses are more more severe than the emotions we perceive from gains.
Therefore we are willing to do anything to prevent loses.
The pain of losing $100 is much greater than the joy from gain $100.

This can be applied to markets
When a market goes up people hardly notice, however even if the market goes down a little it is all over the news.
