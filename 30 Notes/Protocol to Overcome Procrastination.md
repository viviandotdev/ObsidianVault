## Protocol to Overcome Procrastination - Action-Oriented Prioritization

**Core Principle:**
Remove the "deciding" and replace it with "doing." Break the stalemate by committing to *any* **action**, even a small one.

**How It Works (Step-by-Step):**
1.  **List Your Top Tasks:** Jot down the main things you *feel* you should be doing or want to make progress on. Don't overthink this list – just get them out of your head.

2.  **The "Micro-Commitment" Rule:** Pick *any* task from your list and commit to working on it for a very short, defined period: **15-25 minutes.** This short time commitment makes it feel less daunting and lowers the barrier to entry.

3.  **The "Tired? Next!" Rule:**
    *   **If you're still engaged and productive after 15-25 minutes:** Great! Continue working on that task for as long as you feel momentum.
    *   **If you hit the 15-25 minute mark and feel tired, unmotivated, or simply don't want to continue:** Immediately stop that task. *Without hesitation or guilt*, move on to the *next* item on your list and repeat the 15-25 minute micro-commitment.

4.  **Cycle Through Tasks:** Continue this process – doing 15-25 minutes on a task, and if it's not sticking, moving to the next – until you find a task that you *do* want to continue. The goal is to keep the energy flowing and avoid getting stuck.

**Applying It to Your Examples:**
**Areas in order of priority** 
- Programming
- Writing
- Drawing
- Language Learning

**Why This Works:**

*   **Breaks the Inertia:** The small time commitment makes starting feel less overwhelming.
*   **Leverages Momentum:** Once you start, you might find your stride and want to continue, realizing you *did* want to do it after all.
*   **Reduces Decision Fatigue:** By cycling through, you're not making a *big* decision about what to do *all day*; you're just making a *small* decision about the next 15-25 minutes.
*   **Discover Your Flow:** It allows you to "taste test" your tasks and see which one genuinely captures your interest and energy in the moment, leading to more productive deep work.
*   **Builds Consistency:** Even if you only do 15-25 minutes on several things, you've still made progress, which builds confidence and habits.
