## Which attachment style are you?


**How as the way you have been raised affected your attachment style?**
- **Suppression of Emotion**
	As a child expressing emotions, whether joy or sadness, was often met with punishment or dismissal. Examples include being yelled at for laughing loudly or crying, which taught you to suppress your feelings. This led to a belief that emotions were a source of trouble, and you learned to avoid them to cope. **This suppression seems to have made it difficult to be vulnerable and communicate openly in relationships as an adult.**  I couldn't express myself the way I wanted, only in a way that fit how my mom wanted me to represent her.
- **Inconsistent and Unresponsive Parenting**
	You've highlighted several instances of inconsistent and emotionally unresponsive parenting. You mentioned feeling emotionally abandoned, especially by your dad, **who was often absent for important events.** The inconsistency of being loved one moment and criticized the next was confusing and created an environment where you felt it was unsafe to share your hopes and dreams. This also extended to your physical needs, such as your freezing room in the winter, which were ignored.
- **Early Separation From My Parents**
	You believe your attachment issues stem from being raised by your aunts instead of your parents during crucial early years. You feel this period is essential for brain development and forming deep connections, and you **believe you missed out on that "wiring."

**What are the long term of effects of this?**
 * Difficulty managing emotions or feeling a heightened sensitivity to stress.
 * A sense of emotional numbness, where you feel no pain, which you believe is a coping mechanism.
 * A feeling of not being close to your parents or anyone else.
 * A belief that you must figure everything out yourself because no one will help you.
 * This has led to a feeling of being **emotionally disconnected from your parent**s, to the point where you could live your life without them
 * You have a strong sense that a part of your brain or emotional self is missing. While you don't know exactly what this is, you are certain something isn't right. **This feeling of an emotional void is a key part of your struggle, and it is a direct result of your early childhood experiences.**
