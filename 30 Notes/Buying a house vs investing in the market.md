## Buying a house vs investing in the market

**Investing in the S&P 500 historically has better returns. Considering numbers like inflation, opportunity cost, and other expenses is crucial when buying a house.**
We get the idea we should buy a house because **ownership** is valued in America.
- Owning a house means you are successful
	- This popular idea is from the American Dream which is white picket fence, which is decades of messing
- Renting is seen as something that is for "losers", and people often look down on you for doing so. However, buying a house, especially when you are young, is not practical.

We buy things based on status, however when buying the big things, you need to run the numbers because buying based on status is not a practical approach

Every thing is a **tradeoff**, the money you spend on buying is house is all the **missed opportunity** you could have spent traveling and building up an experience. In addition, buying a house ties you do to a single location and can make you feel stuck.

There are many hidden costs in buying a house
	1. Maintenance costs
	2. Inflation costs
	3. Opportunity cost, what that down payment could have been used if invested in the stock market
	4. Phantom costs
