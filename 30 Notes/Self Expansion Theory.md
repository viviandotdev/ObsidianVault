## Self Expansion Theory

- We expand our notion of self to include those we are close to. Studies have shown that the closer you are to a fried, the more the boundary between the two of you blurs. Your brain actually has difficult distinguishing between yourself and the friend. A study conducted on women showed that when women heard the names of their close friends, their brain responded the same way it did when they heard their own name. Friends are like another self.
