## Making friends

Listen to other: The brain gets more pleasure from talking about yourself than it does from food or money. If you want people to like you, let others talk as much as possible around you. Ask questions that start with “what” or “how” because they are difficult to answer with just a simple yes or no.

Giver: Share your interests and knowledge. Look for opportunities to do something for the other person such as offering an introduction to someone that person might not know but would be interested in knowing.

Find similarities, we like people who are like us. Research shows we like people with more who have similar names to us.

Find super friends. Most of the friends you met are likely met through a handful of super friends. These are the most important people for expanding your network.

Make time: Money buys happiness when we spend it on the people we love. Allocate time to spend with the people you care about.

Join groups: You are the 5 people closest to you. Join groups and associate yourself with the type of person you want to become. If you want to be healthier the most direct path for change is to associate yourself with healthier people.
