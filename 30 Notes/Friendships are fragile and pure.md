## Friendships are fragile and pure

Friendships are fragile and pure
	Friendships are pure because they are only there because your truly want them to be.
	Without a marriage certificate, blood bond to support it we have to be diligent in investing and protecting our friendships to sustain them.
	Without formal rules the expectations of a friend become blurry. This makes them fragile.
	Although they are fragile **friendships make use happier than any other relationship**
