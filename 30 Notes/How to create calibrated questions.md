## How to create calibrated questions

### How to create calibrated questions
1. avoid verbs like "can", "is", "are", "do" or. "does", these are closed -ended questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no"
2. start with "**what", "how"** and sometimes "why"
6.  **why** can sometimes backfire because it is accusatory
	1. good why questions:
		- why would you ever change the way you've always done things and try my approach
2. when delivering these questions make sure the tone of voice is respectful
**Framing as a calibrated question**
1. Does this look like something you would liked => How does this look to you?
2. Why did you do it? (sounds accusatory) => What caused to to do it
**Great questions**
4. What about this works for you?
5. what about this doesn't work for you?
6. What about this is important to you?
7. How can I help to make this better for us?
8. How would you like me to proceed?
9. What is it that brought us into this situation?
10. How can we solve this problem?
11. Whatâ€™s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?
12. How am I supposed to do that?
13. How can I do that?
14. how do you price lease renewals?
15. How is the salary figure typically determined for this position?
