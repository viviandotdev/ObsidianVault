## How to build a daily writing habit

1. Carve out time in advance every day from one hour
	every morning after you wake up
2. Set constraints
	- **Time**-300 60 minutes to write and then 5- 10 minutes to edit
	- **Topic**- Set topic constraints
	- **Length**- Atomic essay should be no more than 300 words, this forces you to think cleary and deliver the point effectively.
	- **Platform**- Publish to typeshare,
	- **Cadence**- One essay each day
	- **Environment**- at your desk everyday

I am going to write every day for 60 minutes right when i wake about at my desk. I will write 250-word Atomic Essays about productivity, published on Twitter and to my Social Blog."
