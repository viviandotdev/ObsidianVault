Life is just a string of days. Therefore if can make just a great day then you can make a great life.

People often live each day as if it was your last
This has never made sense to me because this cannot be sustainable. 

Live each day good is enough
Just try not to have too many bad days and you life will turn out good.
If you string together a lot of great days youâ€™re life will be great
