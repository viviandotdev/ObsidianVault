## Fighting doesn’t end marriages; avoiding conflict does.

Fighting shows that you still care. Avoiding conflict means that you have stopped caring and no longer care to bring up issues that you would have before.

This often starts will an issue but you don’t bring it up because you think you know what they will say. The biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has take place. And with time you talk less and assume more. Unspoken assumptions will multiply until you are no longer having conversations with your partner and just having them with yourself. You stopped communicating.

Low thresholds for negatively is good for a marriage. If something bothers you, you should bring it right away so it can get dealt with.
