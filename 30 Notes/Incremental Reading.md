## Incremental Reading

Incremental reading is a method to retain information from reading by breaking down the information overtime into a set of flashcards. 

Rather then reading one book or article at a time, this method works by keeping a large list of articles or books and reading parts of multiple books or articles in each session.

The user reads in portions proportional to their attention span or mood. When an article/book is no longer engaging close and read the next book
The allow for better focus since you will only read when you find the article interesting.

The user prioritizes the the content in the reading list. 

While reading the user **extracts** the most important parts and gradually turn them into flashcards in the questions and answer format or Cloze deletions to be cemented into memory.
