## Intrinsic Motivation

**The drive to engage in an activity because it is inherently enjoyable rather than for the external rewards or pressure**
[[Build something just to prove to myself that I can, don't do it for the users, or money, do it because you can]]

**Intrinsic Motivations** comes from
- **Autonomy**
    - You are doing it because you want to
- **Competence**
    - You are good at or getting better at it
- **Relatedness**
    - There is need for it in the world, being relevant for something bigger than yourself
