## Loneliness

Loneliness is not about the number of people in your life.
**Loneliness heightens our attention to negative emotions because youâ€™re not safe, you have no one looking out for you, and your body knows that historically this has been mucho bad for Homo sapiens.**

People get depressions not because a lot of bad stuff happens to them, it was the ratio of problems to stabilizers in your life. Stabilizers are the support you receive from others.
**Difference between how much social connection you want and how much much social connection you feel you actually have**
