## How I Take Smart Notes- Books/Articles

1. [Read the book.](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/reading-is-searching/) Read swiftly but don’t skip any parts unless they make you vomit or put you to sleep. [Mark all the passages](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/making-proper-marks-in-books/) that stand out and contain useful, interesting or inspiring information.

	-  Read with intention: to find the main ideas.
	- [Reading is really searching](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/reading-is-searching/)
		- What to look for:
				- **Theories**: network of statements,
				- **Models**: representations of reality (maps or metaphors)
				- **Definitions**
				- **Arguments**: connect a premise and a conclusion
				- **Counterarguments**: aim to destroy an argument
				- **Facts**
	- Change headings into questions, highlight the answer in the corresponding paragraph.
	- Avoid is being distracted by various attributes of the texts that are not related to your intention of reading
	- You should be able only to read the highlights and understand the concept.
	- You can also create an index page of the important passages
2. **Read the highlights from the book**. This time you make notes, connect them to past notes (Zettelkasten Method!) and think about what you’ve read. Make mindmaps, drawings, bullet points – everything that helps you to think more clearly.

	-  With **Progressive Summarization**, we are summarizing our notes, and then summarizing _that_ summary, then summarizing _that_ summary, distilling the ideas into smaller and smaller layers each time.
	- After highlights of a book are imported into obsidian, bold passages on the marked passages from the book, then from the bold passages make highlights,
	- Then from the highlighted passage [[How to Write Atomic Notes|create atomic note]]
	- categorize and file (categorize notes, and the make the permanent notes, connect the notes to other ideas in your system)
