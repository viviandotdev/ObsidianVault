## Listicles

When you need ideas, make a list of 3,5,7 of things you have wanted to know in the last 2 years. Listicles are a helpful tool for organizing thoughts. Making numbered lists can help you feel less **overwhelmed** because it forces **organization**.
They also help you focus and see what you need to work on


Everything is a listicle, courses are listicles, your daily to-do list is a listicle. Listicles **provide structure** and gives you a **clear** outline you can use.
