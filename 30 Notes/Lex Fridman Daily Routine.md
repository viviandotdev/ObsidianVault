	- Core principles
		- compassion, ambitions, patient
- **Deep Work Session #1** — Four hours of work with zero distractions.
- **Social Media & Music** — 10 minutes for social and 20 minutes on the guitar or piano. “Music gives me a private moment of joy.”
- **Exercise** — A run of six miles or more, followed by a bodyweight session. This takes about two hours in total.
- **Deep Work Session #2** — Again, four hours of work with zero distractions. Loose thoughts are logged in a Google doc.
- **Eating** — Lex follows a keto diet and supports it with supplements.
- **Shallow Work Session** — This four hours is “open to chaos”.
- **Evening Reading** — One hour of academic papers, followed by an hour of fiction.
