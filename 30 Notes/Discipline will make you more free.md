## Discipline will make you more free

Without discipline, you're not in charge of yourself and your life, like your emotions, your thoughts, **what you will do and what you won't do**, it really doesn't matter what you can do. You're not free.

And when you are in the sway of something, whether it's an **addiction**, whether it's momentum of your career, whether it's just doing what everyone else is doing, you're not free.

And so **creating structure and rules, it can feel limiting**, and you're giving up a freedom, but **you're actually gaining freedom that a lot of people have never even tasted**.
