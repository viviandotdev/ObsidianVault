4 Primary Predictors or divorce, these are negative communication patterns that often leads to the end of a relationship
negative [[communication]] patterns


contempt
	assuming moral superiority over them
defensiveness
	response to criticism, inability to take responsibility and understand the partner's perspective
stonewalling
	response of contempt, withdraws from the interaction and shuts down


**Criticism**
	Complaining is healthy in a marriage but  criticism is not.
	Criticism is attacking someone’s personality whereas complaining is just saying what happened.
	Complaints often begin with “i” and criticisms begin with “you”
**Stonewalling**
	Shutting down and tuning out your response to issues that your partner brings up. Stonewalling means “your concerns are not important enough for me to deal with”. You’re avoiding the conflict.
**Defensiveness**:
	Anything that conveys, “No, the problem isn’t me its you”. Denying responsibilities, making excuses saying “yes, but …”. During an argument don’t counterattack or dodge just listen to your partner’s issues. How you start the argument is super important because it also determines how it ends. the best way to start is by listening for at least 3 minutes.
**Contempt**:
	Contempt is anything that implies your partner is inferior to you. Calling them names and putting them down.
