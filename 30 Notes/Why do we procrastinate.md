**Uncertainly and lack of clarity about a task can trigger emotions like anxiety and stress**.
If you're impulsive and don't know how to manage these emotions, you will often be more easily distracted by your phone to get a quick emotional fix. **Digital distractions facilitate procrastination, they do not cause it.** To overcome procrastination, need to find a way to overcome those emotions.
