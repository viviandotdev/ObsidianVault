**The creation stage** (spend 1 hour a day in this stage starting with your problems list)
- choose system design problems to memorize
- plan the problems
- make sure you understand all the problems and all the details
- make anki flash card blocks for each problems

**The memorization state (daily cards)**
- study anki flash card blocks
- create diagrams and grabbing referencing all the blocks
- **retrospective revision**
	- everyday draw out the diagrams referencing the correct blocks for each problem
	- as you get closed to the interview deadline create the retrospective tables
	- log your work and progress
**when should you start doing retrospective studies?**
- i think while you are going through, as you finish the easy problems, you can start to retrospectively review them
