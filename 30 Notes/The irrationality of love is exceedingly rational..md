## The irrationality of love is exceedingly rational.

Irrational loyalty signals to the person that you are no longer acting out of **selfishness.** They are trying to prove that they will do anything for you instead of themselves.

- But roses which die and have no long-term value are
- Diamonds which are just absurdly expensive rocks that have little resale value are extremely romantic.
