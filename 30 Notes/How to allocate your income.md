## How to allocate your income

- **50% to 60% for your fixed costs:** As we went over earlier, fixed costs are your essentials.
- **10% for your investments:** These include your 401(k), IRA, online brokerage account, and any other investments you have.
- **5% to 10% for your savings goals:** Your emergency fund, a down payment on a home, and other items you want to save toward are part of this category.
- **20% to 35% for guilt-free spending:** This category is your fun money, and it covers anything that's a want, not a need. Examples include going out for meals, new clothes, and entertainment spending.
