## The more you are willing to let the world be something you're aware off the more it it will let you be who you are the Soul


Meditation is the ability to being conscious of consciousness itself. 

When we watch TV we sometimes get immersed into the characters and story that we forget were we are. Spirituality is pulling back and seeing the TV and room you are in. 

Similarly instead of being is getting immersed in the thoughts emotions and drama of the world you can pull back to realize that you are just watching the world.
