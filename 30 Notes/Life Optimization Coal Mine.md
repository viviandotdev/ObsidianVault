**System for Writing**

Choose a topic and then narrow that down to be more specific

Get paid courses and then repackge that content in posts for free

Find 3 articles,videos,essays,tweets on that topic

- Then improve those articles by following **Actionable Guide ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the competition**

    **‚ÄúBetter‚Äù Quality:** If everyone else writes short guides that don‚Äôt go into very much detail, you can be the one to write long, insightful, walkthrough-style guides. Conversely, if everyone else writes long, boring, walkthrough-style guides, you can be the one to condense them into shorter, more digestible bites. ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù Voice: If everyone else‚Äôs How To guides are dense and overwhelming, you can show up to the party and be fast, full of personality, and overly casual. Conversely, if everyone else‚Äôs How To guides are so casual you feel as though you aren‚Äôt being given professional insight, you can be the one to write in a more formal way.

    **‚ÄúBetter‚Äù Organization:** If everyone else writes really great material, but it‚Äôs organized poorly and full of huge paragraphs and no subheads or page breaks for the reader, you can win simply by organizing your writing more visually and ‚Äúappearing‚Äù easier to read and understand.

    **‚ÄúBetter‚Äù Positioned:** If everyone else is writing about the same problem, you can flip the problem on its head to be seen as something radically different. For example, if there are a million guides all titled ‚ÄúHow To Get Your First Client As A Freelance Photographer,‚Äù you can position yourself differently by reframing the problem: ‚ÄúFreelance Photographers, Here‚Äôs Why You Don‚Äôt Want To Charge Your First Client Any Money At All.‚Äù

    **‚ÄúBetter‚Äù For The Audience:** If everyone else is writing about their industry from a broad perspective, you can stand out by choosing not to use universal language and using extremely specific terminology and vernacular only that specific audience would understand‚Äîand vice versa, if everyone else writes exclusively for the niche, you can stand out by writing for a broader, more universal audience.

    **‚ÄúBetter‚Äù Experience:** If everyone else writes as if they are trying to hard-sell readers into buying a product or course, only giving them 10% of the information they actually need and hoping they‚Äôll pay for the other 90%, you can stand out by giving away that same information (and then some) for free.
