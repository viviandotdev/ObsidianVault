## The DUST Model for Procrastination

The reasons we procrastinate

**Difficult**: The task is too challenging which is caused by lack of confidence or lack of skills.
	Strategy- Clearly define a "pre task" to get you started. For example if building an app is too difficult take a online course first that creates a similar app.

**Unclear**: The task is not clearly defined, in order to get things done you need clearly defined actions.
	**Strategy**- break the task down in to simple actionable, clearly defined items ex-presentation prep" becomes "record my self presenting the talk by Tuesday so I can get feedback from my manager on wednesday"

**Scary:** The fear of failure may stop you from doing what you need to do. Create a bigger fear than the original that will make you do the task.
**Tedious**: The task is tedious and boring.
	**Strategy**- listen to podcast while do the work, reward yourself with something once the task is deon
