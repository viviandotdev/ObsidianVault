## Active Listening 

**Active Listening:** Focus on what the other person is saying. This disarms your counterpart. Listen and give your opponent the opportunity to give you more information.

**When we can hear someone but not see them, empathic ability declines only about 4 percent. When we can see someone but not hear them, the drop-off is a whopping 54 percent.** Truth be told, if you wanted to focus on something, skip body language and laser focus on their speech.  Pay less attention to whether they cross their legs and more attention to when their voice changes.


**Active Listening Tactics**
1. Effective Pauses
2. Minimal Encourages
3. Mirroring: Repeat back what they said
4. Labeling: Give your opponents feeling a name
5. Paraphrase: Repeat what your opponents says in your own words
6. Summarize: A good summary is a combination of paraphrasing and labeling. The only possible response for a good summary would be that's right
