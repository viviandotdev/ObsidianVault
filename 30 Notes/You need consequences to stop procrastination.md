I think you are way to comfortable and need to get out of this cycle, I think the main way is to get a new job, my goal is to be confident in my ability to find a job

To stop procrastinating you really need to feel and understand the consequences of not doing the thing you set out do.

**Problem**
I am having trouble focusing there is so many. Things to do I don’t know what to do or when to do it,  I need to set up specific times or conditions of when to do something or else I am always paralyzed and can’t figure out what to do

**Steps  / Framework**
-  set up specific times or conditions of when to do something
- set up consequences for when you don't do what you set out to do.
	- they can be made up consequences
	- or real things that actually scare you
	- it is hard for me because I don't have any real consequences for not succeeding my life is too comfortable
