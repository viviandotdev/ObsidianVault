## Be strategic with what information you learn at what stage of the learning process

Be strategic with what information you learn at what stage of the learning process
	- Early (structure) how?
		- Create anchor points of relevancy
		- Create a mental schema
		- Build the foundational prior knowledge
	-  Later details == relevant
		- After build the foundation, you can then build the details which connect to the foundational knowledge.
		- At each step as you build more knowledge and connections the more details you can add

This idea is similar to language learning, where you want to find and listen to sources that are just above your comprehension level. When sentence mining, you want to look for and learn from i + 1 sentences. There are sentences where you don't understand one word or grammar rule. This makes it easy to add that word to your prior knowledge, since it is just above what you already know.

In language learning, you want to build a strong foundation of the most common words. These words can build the foundation for which to you can connect other words and build a strong network of words and phrases that you can use.

This is the same for learning new material. You don't want to jump right into the advanced details of the material. Instead, you want to gradually build on the material you already know.
At the start of learning something new, you want to create structure and anchor points, so that as you learn more details or specific facts these fact have something that they can be connected to.
