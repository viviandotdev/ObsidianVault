### Active Recall

### How do you do active recall?
1. **On a blank sheet of paper**, recall everything you know about the topic / concept you are trying to learn.
	- Recall mind maps
	- Draw diagrams of the information
	- Chunk your notes together to make it easier to remember
2. Then look at your resources to seem what you missed, make all the corrections make any extra notes
3. Repeat this process in spaced intervals
	10 minutes
	2–3 hours
	1 day
	2–3 days
	1 week

### Benefits of Active Recall
1. Reduces confusion of similar words. For example, in Chinese you might get confused between similar words
2. Recognizing something is different from actually knowing something
3. Active recall is closest to simulating how you would actually apply the information.
4. Struggling to retrieve information helps the brain learn and remember better **even if the retrieval is unsuccessful or incorrect**. The process of strengthing the ability to search and find that information helps people remember better.
