## One of the easiest ways to be unhappy is to constantly think about problems you have no control over

**Personal Experience**
- Politics is not something that is worth my time because it makes me think about problems that I cannot control
- Like the impact that I can make with my decision is not enough to make me feel that all the research into developing that opinion seems worth it.
- All I can about making a change to all these problems is to vote.
- I think there are more interesting problems in my life that will actually make my life better than figuring out who to vote for.
- What are these problems?
	- Becoming healthier
	- Learning more, becoming more curious about topics and learning about them
	- Becoming a better programmer
	- Becoming a better friend
	- Becoming a better person who makes good decisions and helps out the people around them
