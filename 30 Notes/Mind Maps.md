Mind-maps are a visual learning tool to help you organize information and ideas around a central topic.

Mind maps allow you to branch out into subtopics and related concepts using keywords, images, colors and shapes.

They can be used as a hierarchical brainstorming and note-taking tool to help users understand and generate complex information and new ideas.

They help with structuring thoughts.
