- Growing up, I only had one close friend during each main period of my life.
  - When I was really young, I think that was my sister
  - In elementary school, I had one friend from K-2nd grade, but she moved to Massachusetts.
  - From 3rd-5th grade, I was close with Abby.
  - From 6th-8th grade, I was close with Sharon.
  - From 9th-12th grade, I was basically alone and had no close friends.
  - In college, I made friends with my roommates and was close with Sandy and Chris.
- I've always been very sensitive and probably have the [[SERT Gene]]. I remember crying a lot as a child because I got overwhelmed easily by arguments, raised voices, and expressions of disappointment or anger.
  - Mom and Dad [[thought]] solving the problem was just by yelling at me more, which I don't think solved the problem and just made me close off to them more.
  - Small things made me cry, like when my friends took my glasses in middle school, or when a girl kept hitting me with her hair in elementary school.
  - In 4th grade, I cried during a presentation because someone said they couldn't hear me.
- I think these experiences taught me to hide my feelings and not express myself, which explains why I'm not very expressive and am closed off from others.
- Socially, I'm very sensitive. A lot of people stress me out. In my college freshman year, I would get nosebleeds every night from meeting so many people. My face was always red, and my heart was always racing.
