## Temporal Landmarks

Temporal landmarks are dates and times that differentiate your current self from your past self.
Common temporal landmarks are
- a new year
- your birthday
- Monday's
- start of the month

You can also identify the temporal landmarks within a day. **This gives you more opportunities to correct your day if it is not going well in the beginning**. Sometimes you can feel like the whole day is wasted, because of a single thing that may have happened. This all or nothing mindset is why we say we will try again tomorrow.  These **temporal landmarks allow you start fresh within the day.**
