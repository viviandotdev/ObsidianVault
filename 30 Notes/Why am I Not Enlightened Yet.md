## Why am I Not Enlightened Yet?

Enlightenment cannot be found, people go around the world searching for something that cannot be found. 

Imagine you are watching a movie, enlightened is seeing the screen behind all the characters and scenes in the movie. You don’t need to search for enlightenment, because it it is walks there in front of you you just need to become aware. **At best enlightenment is overlooked not missing.**

**The screen is overlooked due your fascination with our body and mind and the world.** Relax your attentions and focus from the body mind and world, blur it so you can see the screen.

Enlightens is being aware of the awareness of being aware.
