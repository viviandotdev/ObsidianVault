If you want to build and create some thing do it
I think my fear is that I am not taking the more efficient path or using the right tools to learn or create a fastest so I don't do it at all.

If you do it wrong at least to lear from it and make progress,
When you do nothing you gain nothing from it

running slowly is better than not running at all
