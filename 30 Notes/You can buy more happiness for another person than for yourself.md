## You can buy more happiness for another person than for yourself

**Why people have kids**

You can often bring more happiness to others than to yourself through spending.

Perhaps this is why people have children. Every dollar spent on a child can bring them more joy than if you spent it on yourself. For instance, buying a toy truck for $50 can make a child ten times happier than spending ten times that amount on something for yourself. This is because, for children, everything is novel and experiences are fresh and exciting. As we age, we become more jaded, and the things that once brought us happiness may no longer have the same effect.
