## Database Relationships

Database relationships are associations between tables in a relational database. These relationships define how data in one table is related to data in another table. There are three primary types of database relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many (or many-to-one), and many-to-many.

1. [[One to One Relationship]]:
    - In a one-to-one relationship, each row in one table is associated with exactly one row in another table, and vice versa.
    - This type of relationship is relatively rare in relational databases.
    - Example: A database that stores employee information might have a one-to-one relationship between the "Employee" table and the "EmployeeAddress" table.
2. **One-to-Many Relationship (Many-to-One):**
    - In a one-to-many relationship, each row in one table can be associated with one or more rows in another table, but each row in the second table is associated with only one row in the first table.
    - This is the most common type of relationship in relational databases.
    - Example: In a bookstore database, each "Author" can have multiple "Books," but each "Book" is written by one "Author."
3. [[Many to many relationship]]
- In a many-to-many relationship, each row in one table can be associated with multiple rows in another table, and vice versa.
    - To represent many-to-many relationships, an intermediary or junction table (also called a join table or pivot table) is used to link the two tables.
    - Example: In a social media application, a "User" can belong to multiple "Groups," and each "Group" can have multiple "Users." This relationship is represented using a junction table that stores user-group associations.

In addition to these primary relationship types, there are various ways to enforce and represent relationships in a relational database:

- **Foreign Keys:** Foreign keys are columns in a table that refer to the primary key of another table. They enforce referential integrity and are used to establish relationships between tables.

- **Primary Keys:** Primary keys uniquely identify rows in a table. They are often used as the basis for defining relationships with foreign keys in other tables.

- **Cascade Operations:** Cascade operations (e.g., CASCADE DELETE) allow changes in one table to propagate to related tables. For example, deleting a record in the parent table can automatically delete related records in child tables.

- **Join Operations:** SQL queries often involve joining tables together to retrieve data from related tables. JOIN clauses are used to specify how tables are related in a query.


Database relationships are a fundamental concept in relational databases and are essential for organizing and querying data efficiently while maintaining data integrity. Properly defining and managing relationships is crucial for designing effective database schemas.
