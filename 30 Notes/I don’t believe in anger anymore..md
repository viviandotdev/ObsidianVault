I don't believe in getting angry, i think anger shows a lack of control over your own emotions. **Often getting angry hurts another individual emotionally or physically which is not some thing i want to do**. I’ve always been the one who has been hurt my other people’s anger, I know how much pain and how much sucks to receive someone else’s anger so I know that I would never want to make someone feel that way which is why I don’t get angry

- Don't let anger control you
- Seek to understand other people's perspective instead of blaming they making them feel bad for what they did wrong
- One of the best ways to test other people's anger is to test their patience over small things. If they get upset over the littlest things then that is gives you a clue into the way they will react over larger issues.
