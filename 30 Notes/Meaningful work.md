## Meaningful work

The most motivating thing is to find work that is meaningful. When we feel like the work we do is futile and pointless, our happiness and motivation plummets. This is why many people hate their office jobs and will often check out or try to do this work.
Meaningful work means doing something that is
- important to you.
- Something you are good at. ([[Signature strengths]])
The more hours per day you get to user your strengths to do what you do best, the less likely you are to report experiencing worry, stress, anger, sadness or pain.
We like to do what is easy, but not what makes us happy. Simulation is what makes us the most happy. We want need to do less work, we want engaging and challenging work.
