## You are happiest when working towards your goals, not when you have achieved them

There are only a few moments in life where you will feel like you have achieved your goals. Those celebratory moments are fleeting and you will not have much of them.

What is most important in life is the process.

This means that you are much closer to being the happiest version of yourself than you think.

For example when you play games you are happiest when you are mining and building and have things to do.
Once you accomplish a goal you move on to the next thing you want to build and create.
The game actually gets boring when you complete everything that there is to do and you get sad and quit, because you have completed everything.
Same thing with life, you are the most fulfilled when you are working towards something.
