## My PKM Workflows - Global Guidelines

**By standardizing** and streamlining both the format of our notes and the steps by which we process them, **the real work can come to the forefront: thinking, reflecting, writing, discussing, testing, and sharing.** This is the work that adds value, and now we have the time to do it more effectively. --Tiago Forte
