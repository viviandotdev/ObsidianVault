### Our reality is influenced as much by our thoughts as it is by what actually happened.

Our reality is influenced as much by our thoughts as it is by what actually happened.
Our thoughts have a big influence on our reality. **We are often too busy making stories about what actually happening rather than paying attention to what is actually happening.**
For example, if cuts you off in traffic, you might think that person is a jerk or being rude. But that is just a story you made up in your head. How do you know this person is a jerk? They could have a medical emergency and need to rush to the hospital. All the information you know is that this person cut you off. Everything else is just a story you created that may or may not be true.
