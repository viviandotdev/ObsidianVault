## How to deal with narcissists

1. Emphasize similarity: this capitalizes on narcissist weakness (self-love). If someone else is like them, how can they hurt that other person?
2. emphasize vulnerability
	- voice the important of the relationship and reveal your feelings. Showing anger will backfire but showing disappointments is effective.
	- When a narcissistant hurts you instead of getting angry at them say something like “That hurt my feelings. Is that what you intended?”
	- This will often make them back pedal
3. Emphasize community
	- Remind that about family and the connections they have. Because narcissists are not accustomed to empathy it hits a a lot harder when they feel it. By default that are not empathetic so reminding them of their loved ones can help kick the empathy back into gear.
