Originality is overrated

The best way to learn is to copy the people you look up to

[[New discoveries are usually just variations of existing things.]]
Steal like an artist

Output native people spend years copying work before they ever produce anything meaningful on their own

Artists will do master copies for years because they can even come up with anything good,

I think i will spend the next 5 years of my 20's just copying i will copy everyone and everything,
I will copy the people i want to become
I will copy the **art that i Like** 
I will copy the **code** 
I will copy **writing**
