Example 
Studying is the child’s tasks not the parent’s task.
My relationship with troubles are caused by the separation of tasks
My mother is trying to intrude on my tasks of finding partner
This is my task and the outcome will affect me the most

But they are clearly doing so in order to fulfil their own goals, which could be their appearance in the eyes of society, their need to put on airs, or their desire for control, for example. In other words, it is not ‘for your own good’, but for the parents’. **And it is because the child senses this deception that he rebels.**


**Who ultimately is going to receive the end result brought about by the choice that is made?**

**Solution**
Instead, it is by knowing what the child is doing that one protects him. **If it’s studying that is the issue, one tells the child that that is his task, and one lets him know that one is ready to ==assist== him whenever he has the urge to study.** But one must not intrude on the child’s task. When no requests are being made, it does not do to meddle in things.


Not intruding in other people’s task does not mean you don’t have to be interested in the what the child is doing.
**Not intruding does not mean non-interference.**
Instead of telling them you need to study now.
==You can let them know that you are ready to assist them when they want to study.==

You are the only one that cna change your self. Other people cannot do this for you
