You’re body is still capable of doing it you don’t need that much rest
Even when you don't want to do something you can do it tired,
For example you show up to work everyday because you have to,
You can do that for yourself to,
You should choose to show up for yourself and your dreams as well
Why is it easier for you to show up for some elses dream instead of your own?
**You are capable of going to school and work every day even when you don't want to.**
**You should be able to that with your dreams as well**
