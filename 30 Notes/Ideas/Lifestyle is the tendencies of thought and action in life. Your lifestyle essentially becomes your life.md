**Lifestyle = Personality**
- In Adlerian psychology, your lifestyle (patterns of thought and action) is your personality
- Unlike "personality" which sounds fixed, "lifestyle" emphasizes that you can change

**Why People Stay Stuck**
- Many believe personality is unchangeable and use this as an excuse to avoid growth
- We often choose familiar unhappiness over the stress and anxiety that comes with change

**The Path Forward**
- Your lifestyle naturally evolves (childhood vs. adulthood), proving change is possible
- Designing a fulfilling, sustainable lifestyle requires courage
- Lasting happiness comes from intentionally creating a lifestyle you can maintain long-term
