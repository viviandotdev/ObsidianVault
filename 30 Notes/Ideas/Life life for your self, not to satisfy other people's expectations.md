Wen you seek recognition of others you think about how one is judged is my others therefore you living if other people'e lives which is suffering.

**If you don't live to satisfy other people's expectations, this means that ==you should not expect other people to live up to your expectations either==.** 

**interpersonal problems that can occur**
- many people grow to live to satify the exepections of their parietns or teacher which can lead to resentment. 
- people can get mad or upset when they don't live up to your expections but that is not something you can control
