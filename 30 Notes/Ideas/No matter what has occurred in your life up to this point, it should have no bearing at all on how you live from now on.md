Freud believe that the past determined who we are today. This idea denies our free will and is driven by determinism. If our past determined everything and who we are today could not take steps forward to change our lives, we would end up in a kind of nihilism where we lose all hope.

Rather, as Adler’s teleology tells us, ‘[[No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on]].’ That you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines your own life.



Present choices dictate your future
Do not let your past hold you back
Life in present always moving forward and doing the best with what you have now
