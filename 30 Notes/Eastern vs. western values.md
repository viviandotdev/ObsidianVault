**I terms of values I am a mix between eastern and western values**
==equality vs hierarchy==
- For relationships, I values equality in relationships, I prefer peer relationships, I don't like interacting people who don't see me as a peer
==collectivism vs individualism==
- I think this is more difficult for me to decide, I think at my core I am more individual, I think for my own happiness and peace individualism is more important to me.
- However I can see the benefits of collectivism but I think it also can create trauma where i feel i need to sacrifice my happiness to my others happy which will make me happy?
- This is impossible because that is not within your control, **no matter what you do the other person may never be satisfied so what is the point of trying to satisfy them**?
- **Isn't it better to put your energy towards what is meaningful to you and satisfying your own wants and desires**
==direct vs in-direct communication==
- I think direct communication is healthier than in-direct communication
==short vs long term==
- i believe in things that will last a long time, I don't like short term solutions
