### Self Compassion
Self Compassion is accepting that you are human and will make mistakes. Studies have shown people with self compassion donâ€™t beat themselves up when they make mistakes and have a less fear of failure which leads to less procrastination and more. This forgiving approach allows you to take more responsibility for your actions and being saddened by them.
