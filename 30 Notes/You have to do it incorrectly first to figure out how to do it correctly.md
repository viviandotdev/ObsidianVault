- You must write bad code before you can write good code.
- You must write badly before you can learn to write well.
- **Doing it slowly and wrong is better than just doing nothing.**
If you want to build and create some thing do it
I think my fear is that I am not taking the more efficient path or using the right tools to learn or create a fastest so I don't do it at all.

If you do it wrong at least to lear from it and make progress,
When you do nothing you gain nothing from it

running slowly is better than not running at all
