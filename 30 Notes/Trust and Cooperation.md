## Tit for Tat Strategy
Tit for Tat is a common strategy showed to be effective in ethical dilemmas where you need to choose whether to act cooperatively or to be selfish. In this strategy, the player initially chooses to cooperate, then mimics the opponent's previous move.
An improvement on this strategy is the generous TFT, rather than always repeating the last move it will occasionally forgive and cooperate even after being betrayed.
