My first pricing was free || monthly 2.99usd || one time 29.99, there were +200 users with 0 conversion
then one day there is a guy on twitter who roasted my landing page, while roasting he said pricing is terrible, **just make it one time 10 usd no free tier**. then in first day of changing i got 10 clients
you should make  super simple pricing ,
free, monthly (one time tier)
