## Why do we procrastinate

The root of why we procrastinate it our lack of control over our **emotions**.
**Lack of Clarity**
	**Uncertainly and lack of clarity about a task can trigger emotions like anxiety and stress**.
	If you're impulsive and don't know how to manage these emotions, you will often be more easily distracted by your phone to get a quick emotional fix. **Digital distractions facilitate procrastination, they do not cause it.** To overcome procrastination, need to find a way to overcome those emotions.
**Fear of criticism**, 
	we don't do the things we want to because we fear the [[constant criticism in a relationship can prevent growth|criticism]] that might come along if we tried.

**Decision Paralysis**
	You get overwhelmed by choice and don't know where to start. Consequently, you do nothing at all, or only the absolute easiest things, which often aren't truly productive towards your goals.
