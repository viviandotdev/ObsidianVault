**Why should you make things**
- Make things that you would like to see exist
- Make things to prove to yourself that you can, don’t do it for the users, or money, do it because you can
- Making good new things is proof of thinking
	- When making new things there are thousands of decisions that need to made to create a good product
	- If you make all the "correct" decisions you will make something good
- If you make something good you’ll often be helping people even if you didn’t mean to
	- Newton was driven by curiosity and ambition, **he did not even think about the practical effects of his work**, yet the effect of his work on the world has been.
- Make something wonderful so you can put it back in the stream of humanity
- I'm the only person in the world with my unique experiences, so **if there is something within you that you are capable of producing it deserves to be created because you are the only person who can and will ever create it**
- The value in art is not how many people see it, **the value comes from how many people couldn't have created what you can**.
- **Make something so you can put it back into the pool of human experience**
