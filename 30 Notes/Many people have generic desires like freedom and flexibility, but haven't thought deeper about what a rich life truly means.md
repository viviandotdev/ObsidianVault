## Many people have generic desires like freedom and flexibility, but haven't thought deeper about what a rich life truly means

A rich life is planned down to the details. Most people have no idea what their rich life looks like. When you ask people why they want financial freedom, they often respond when so they can do whatever they want. But they never go into detail exactly what it is that they want.
**Building a rich life requires intentionality, individuality, and ongoing effort.** Money can be used as a tool to solve problems and create an ideal life. Designing a rich life is one of the most important pieces of work we can ever do.

Money is a tool for living the life you want. However, you must think about how you will intentionally use that money.
**I want to travel**
How many times do you want to travel a year?
When do you want to travel?
Which airline will you travel with?
Which places will you travel?
