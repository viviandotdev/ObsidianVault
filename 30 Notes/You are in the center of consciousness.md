## You are in the center of consciousness

You are behind everything, just watching. That is your true home. Take everything else away and you’re still there, aware that everything is gone. But take the center of awareness away, and there is nothing. That center is the seat of Self. **From that seat, you are aware that there are thoughts, emotions, and a world coming in through your senses. But now you are aware that you’re aware.**
