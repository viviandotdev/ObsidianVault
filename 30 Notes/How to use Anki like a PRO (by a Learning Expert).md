Dedicated Long study session **3-4 hours**
1. **Targeted Review**
	1. Mark the ones that correct and incorrect 3 times in a row
	2. Look at the ones you got incorrect 3 times in a row
		- take some time to look at these cards and really try to connect them into your network of prior knowledge
	3. For the ones you got correct upgrade the cards, merge multiple cards together by thinking about how to connect them.
1. **Consolidation and Preparation**
	"Normal" Study Time
	Review materials and write your notes
	Method for encoding the material (linking the ideas to the network), for small bit's of information you need to remember create flashcards
	Do not dump everything into the flash cards
	Organizing the information you learn. (chunking the information into categories)
3. **Preview**
	 Priming yourself to the material you have not covered yet. Pre-study
