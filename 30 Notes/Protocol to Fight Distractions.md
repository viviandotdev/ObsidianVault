## Protocol to Fight Distractions

Protocol to Fight of Distractions
	1. identify that discomfort
	2. take out a journal (time, trigger, action)
	3. write down your sensations
	4. the "10 min rule", the time you have to wait before you can give in on this distraction![[Screenshot 2024-03-23 at 7.21.54 PM.png]]

**SPUNC**-> the only rule is that you just need to long everything you do, just go about your normal, and log everything this will prevent you from task twitching because the act of task switching is not slightly more annoying,
**Record every task, action, drive, chore, argument, presentation, discussion, meal, meeting**, and anything else you do during the day. Be specific with each action, **except for personal hygiene tasks**. Your log will look like this.

**Tally up your tasks and count the number of wasted minutes through out the day**
