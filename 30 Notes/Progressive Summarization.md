**Layer 1** is the starting point of Progressive Summarization, like the bedrock on which everything else is built:

**Layer 2** is the first round of true summarization, in which I **bold only the best parts** of the passages I’ve imported. Again, I have no explicit criteria. I look for keywords, key phrases, and key sentences that I feel represent the core or essence of the idea being discussed.

For **Layer 3**, I switch to **highlighting, so I can make out the smaller number of highlighted passages among all the bolded ones**. This time, I’m looking for the “best of the best,” only highlighting something if it is truly unique or valuable. And again, I’m only adding this third layer when I’m already reviewing the note anyway.


For **Layer 4**, I’m still summarizing, but going beyond highlighting the words of others, to recording my own. For a small number of notes that are the most insightful, **I summarize layers 2 and 3 in an informal executive summary** at the top of the note, restating the key points in my own words.


For **layer 5**, I remix them. After pulling them apart and dissecting them from every angle in layers 1–4, I add my own personality and creativity and turn them into something else.
 - create “sketchnotes” of the book’s key points.
