## How to build “another self”

(Time + Vulnerability)
**Vulnerability**
Make the time, vulnerably share your thoughts, and raise the stakes. If all goes well, they do the same. This gets us away from transactional relationships.
Not being vulnerable kills friendships, and also increase your chances of developing illnesses.

Share vulnerable things with your friends, when your friend admits to something vulnerable don’t judge them instead accept them and then raise the stakes, If you feel emotionally safe and getting a positive reaction you can continue to share to strength the bond.

**Time**
Time is powerful because it scare. Giving someone your time makes them feel special. If i give you an hour of my time a everyday, I cannot do that for more than 24 people.

Find something to do together consistently. Touching base in some form every two weeks is a good cadence for maintains friendships

It takes 60 hours to develop a light friendship and 100 hours to become friends and 200 - 300 hours to become best friends.
