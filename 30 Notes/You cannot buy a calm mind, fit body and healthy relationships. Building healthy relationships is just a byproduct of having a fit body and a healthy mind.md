[[A Calm Mind, a Fit Body, a House Full of Love]]

The first thing you realize when you’ve made a bunch of money is that you’re still the same person. If you’re happy, you’re happy. If you’re unhappy, you’re unhappy. If you’re calm and fulfilled and peaceful, you’re still that same person. 
I know lots of very **rich people who are extremely out of shape**. I know lots of **rich people who have really bad family lives.** I know lots of **rich people who are internally a mess.**

So I think those three things—**your health, your mental health and your close relationships—are things you have to cultivate**. They can **bring you a lot more peace and happiness than any amount of money ever will.**

**Braindump, Summary, & Reference Notes**
*Write out everything that comes to mind. A summary in a way that you understand at this point in your life. Be sure to include the notes you took if you already took them.*

A calm internal state is not something that can be solved with money. This requires a lot of personal work. There many wealthy people who are not happy because they are out of shape or having bad relationships with their family members. Your **physical health, mental health and close relationships** will bring you more peace and happiness than money ever will. 

I think a **loving household and relationships** actually **fall naturally out of the other things.** If you have a **calm mind and you’ve already made money, you should have good relationships**


**Common Goals, Problems, & Advice**
*Everyone is working towards a goal, which one? What are the problems associated with those goals? What common advice is given to overcome those problems? This starts to frame our unique perspective.*

  - Whats the point of having and making some much money if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it?
  - Everyone is chasing money and success not realizing that I may not bring them the happiness that they want.


**Personal Experience**
*What experiences, stories, or problems you’ve faced that come to mind?*

  - If you have a calm mind and already make money you should naturally have good relationships.
  - I think dad does not have a calm internal state at all. He definitely holds a lot of anger inside. Even tough he has money his relationship with his family is not great because he does not have a healthy internal state. 

**Potential Framework, System, or Solution**
*Can you create a memorable, step-by-step solution to solving the problem? You can flesh this out in your content. Be sure to add your own unique name to it!*

  - First focus on yourself, create a calm mind and a fit body and naturally you will be able to build strong relationships easily.
