## How to Learn Blender

**Day 1- 5** Learning
Get familiar with blender, watch a beginner tutorial course, on interesting projects. Get comfortable with keyboard shortcuts
The Praka. School or whatever

**Day 6 - 70** Learning Projects
**Method #1: 1-on 1-off**

- 1 tutorial project
- 1 project created entirely by myself
- Rinse and repeat

**Method #2: 1-hard 1-easy**
I spent 3 days working on the snow globe by following an intense [tutorial](https://youtu.be/BgMYPGWFzG4). After that, I created a simple popsicle

**Tip**
When I was stuck in modeling, I found it’s easier to delete the unfinished work and start over — a fresh start helps with problem-solving.
