## This voice exists to make you feel more comfortable and control of the world around you

Through constant narration it recreates the outside world inside yourself to give you a sense of control.

For example if you are cold it will say "It's cold" but "We're almost home, just a few more minutes", It's makes you feel like you can always do something to control and make the experience better.
But in reality the experience is the same, you will still have to endure cold.

Personal growth is realizing that you are watching this voice and you don't always need it's protection.
