## Negative Sentiment Override

(NSO): this is the basically the **opposite** of idealization. Instead it of remembering and all the positive things your partner has done for you, you only focus on the negative things.
Idealization is positive delusion, NSO is disillusionment (negative delusion). You are now biased against your partner instead of for your partner. **The facts have not changed but just your interpretation of them. Instead of attributing problems to context, attributions now lie in someoneâ€™s poor character traits**
	your partner, forgot to take you the trash today.
		- instead of assuming they were busy, the go-to assumption is now because they are a horrible person who want to drive me insane.
