## How to build a visual library

Choose a scene from a movie you really like and study the objects of the scene for a month
Choose an object a day and study them from all angles

]I schedule at least one hour to study an object of choice.  
I make sure I have sufficient reference pictures of the subject. 
	That means; I have references of every angle. 
	These images have preferably a high resolution as well, so I can zoom in of needed to study the minor details
With the reference images as support I start drawing the object from different angles. 
	That way I practice my perspective skills but I also have to think where each part the object has to go. 
	By doing so, I’m already forced to think and construct the image in my mind before even touching the paper.
To finish the studies, I sometimes reference my favourite artist and see how they draw / render something (ie. a tire of a car). I like to apply the same rendering process on my studies. That’s called smart-stealing.

**Exercise- Memory Drawing or Cognitive Drawing**
1. Choose an object to study
2. Gather reference pictures of that object, find references of every angle and make sure they are high resolution so we can zoom in
3. Draw the object from reference
4. Draw the object from memory
5. Correct any mistakes
	- note what you got wrong
	- write it down and make quick rough sketch from observation where you draw it correctly
2. Draw the object from memory (repeat until memorized)
3. If you like drawing it add it to your anki deck
4. (Optional)- Reference your favorite artists that apply the same rendering process or style on your studies. 



filling pages with lots of drawings, as that looks good. Looking at these pages in the future will motivate you to start drawing.
