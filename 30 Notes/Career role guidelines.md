## Career role guidelines

- **Keep a “wins” document and rotate it yearly/quarterly based on performance reviews. Use this to track things you’d put on your internal resume.**
- Reach out to people in the company to network and learn about their team. Do maybe 1 per month. **Ask for recurring 1:1s with people who you can learn from**. Depending on the team I think a 1:1 with everyone on your team at least monthly is a huge benefit.
	- I think I fear taking up people's team or setting up useless meetings with no clear goal,
	- You need to understand the full process
	- Members of the team you should know when developing software products
		- Lead Developers 
- Spend a LOT of time reading old team docs. Pentest reports, security evaluations. This is a gold mine of information.
- Have a shared 1:1 doc with your manager and discuss it during your 1:1s. This can be simple things like links to a training you want to take or that you discussed taking PTO or bigger things like career growth, promo, etc
	- How do you want to grow?

- Track data for important things. When starting a project what data can you collect? How can you show your impact?
- Start an onboarding guide day 1. What was annoying? What did you wish you had? Just make a list and then fill it in as you learn more. Then share with future new hires.
- When writing docs to be shared, use formatting to draw the reader to the most important ideas (no one will read your docs, they’ll skim it). Use color, bold, monospace for code, tables, diagrams.

- Keep a personal scratchpad. A piece of paper you can have on your desk for things to attend to outside of work when you have a minute. “Oh, I need to reschedule a dentist appointment”. Important, but I tend to remember this right when I’m in the middle of something.
