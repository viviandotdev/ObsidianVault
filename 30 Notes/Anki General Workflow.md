**things you want to remember**
- Add the things you want to remember sporadically

**language learning**
- keep a document of new words and sentences you come across
- at the end of the week, go through document and filter words and sentences you want to learn and add them to anki


**tips**
- do not add cards you do not fully understand
	- add only cards you fully understand
- review things you are interested in and actually want to remember or else it will just become a burdern
	- it is better to delete it, if you are not sure, if it is really that important the concept will come back to you
- reduce new cards to reduce study time
	- if you think you spend too much time on anki then stop studying less new cards
