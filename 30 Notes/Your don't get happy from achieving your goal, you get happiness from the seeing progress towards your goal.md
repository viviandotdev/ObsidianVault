## Your don't get happy from achieving your goal, you get happiness from the seeing progress towards your goal

**Idea**
It is the progress towards your goals that makes you happy not achieving the goal itself
Therefore you are much close to feeling of happiness than you think because just the act of seeing progress is enough to make you happy

- When I maxed out all my gear and built everything is needed I actually feel a little empty
