## Dealing with frustration and the importance of adaptability

1. Frustration arises from having high standards and expectations.
2. Question the need for things to be a certain way. Just accept things for the way they are. Not everything needs to be exactly like the way you want it to be
3. Being adaptable leads to peace.
4. Want things to be the way they are for inner peace.
5. Don't attach happiness to external factors like weather.

Â Epictetus's thing is he says, like, **don't want things to be a certain way. Want them to be the way that they are**. That is the path to peace. And I think about, it's like, Hey, like, if I wake up, and I go, I need the weather to be a certain way today. Well, then there's a pretty big chance that I'm not going to be happy.
