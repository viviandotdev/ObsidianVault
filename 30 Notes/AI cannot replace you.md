Sure you can have AI do everything for you, however that just takes the enjoyment out of everything if you let AI do everything for you. I enjoy coding, I enjoy making all the decisions to create something that feels like it come from me.

Making art is about the decisions you make to create the final outcome not matter how big or small,
AI takes away that decision making process, with a single prompt it is making hundreds or thousands of decisions for you, however by doing that it is not creating anything interesting or new since it is just gathering the average
