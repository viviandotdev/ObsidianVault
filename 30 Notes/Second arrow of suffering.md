### Second arrow of suffering
When you feel physical suffering, you react to it emotionally. This is the second arrow of suffering, how you react to that initial suffering can cause you mental pain. Another example is when you feel angry. When people are angry, they will react with physical violence or yelling. This is additional suffering that you are creating for yourself and the person you are angry at. However, instead you should pause and feel the emotion and not react to it.
#source/quote
"Letting go of reactivity is letting go of the need to punch the wall, the need to react to our suffering in rage or despair that only creates more suffering when we have to, say, get stitches or repair a hole in the wall."
