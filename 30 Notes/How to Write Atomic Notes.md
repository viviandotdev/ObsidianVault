	- up:: (the parent link, a link that points down to this link)
	- related:: (related links)
2. *Highly Linked*-atomic notes **should link to another related atomic notes**
	- use [[The Idea Compass]] for questions on where to link your notes
		 North: Where does the idea come from?
		 East: What is similar to this idea?
		 West: What is the opposite of this idea?
		 South: What does this idea lead to?
3. *Stage*: Each atomic note should have a status indicating the stage the note is in
4. *Title*: the title of an atomic note should be a clear and concise statement
5. *Content*: The content of an atomic note is **written in your own words** and should ideally focus on **one idea.**
		Reference the existing fleeting or literature note and use it as a writing prompt to elaborate on the idea until it can be understood without its original context. Write them carefully, as if for someone else.
		Aim to have it no shorter than a tweet (180 characters) and no longer than an atomic essay (300-500 words).
