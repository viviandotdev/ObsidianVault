## It does not matter what job I have or for what company i work for, I don't think i will be ever be passionate building something for someone else. 

Your job is not meant to be the only thing you have, you should have other interests that full fill you

- do not tie your entire identity to your work
- you don't have to chase prestige, 
	- i am not interested in prestige or getting a higher paying job or even getting a rise
	- work is not meant to be something that fulfills me 
	- it does not matter what job I have or for what company i work for, I don't think i will be ever be passionate building something for someone else. 
	- for example working at cigna, I am so aware. of what the company does I doesn't feel good or right to work really hard for a company that is literally killing people 


- hedge your identity by engaging in diverse activities
	-  hedging is to minimize downside risk, even if it means potentially limiting upside potential.
- hedge your identity to minimize downside risk, you want to minimize your risk of depression. Diversification limits your potential in excelling in only one area because you need to focus elsewhere, however this worth it because if one area becomes difficult you can find fulfillment in other areas.
- not everything will be going well, for example you could have a bad day at work but maybe hit a PR at the gym, this can dramatically improve your mood and help with depression.
