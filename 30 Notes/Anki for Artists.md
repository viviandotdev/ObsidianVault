Use Anki for drawing challenges and exercises group the cards into skills
**Creating Cards**
1. Tackle a new page of a book
2. Covert the knowledge in the book into a card with a (challenge and example)
3. The front is the challenge and questions
4. The back is an example with challenge solution and answer to the question (page content)


### Examples
**Prompts**
Each book gets it own deck or just have a single deck for everything and tag by books

**what is comparative measurement?**
**challenge**
find some references
draw them and make them as accurate as possible by using the methods of comparative measurement

**Quickly draw the cervical spine in a non-standard anatomical view. Don’t be boring**

_Anatomy of Movement_ and tackle just a single new page. I try to convert every bit of knowledge on that page into flashcards that will tax any skills and all the knowledge I can find on that page.

Finish the drawings for the cards I photograph them, then convert them into actual flashcards inside of Anki, and add them to my running “Anatomy” deck
