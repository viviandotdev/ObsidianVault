## Combining different strengths sets you apart and leads to exceptional results by creating are opportunities.

**Topic**
*What are you writing about from The Queue? This can be a quote, tweet, idea, thought, interest, or even a broad topic.*

> I'm not the best writer, but it is a strength. I might be a 90th percentile writer.  
> 
> And I'm not the best marketer, but it is a strength. Again, maybe 90th percentile? I'm better than most, but if you pass 100 people on the street it won't be hard to find some people better than me.

> What I have gradually learned is that it is not your strengths, **but your combination of strengths that sets you apart**. It is the fact that writing and marketing are mutually reinforcing—and that I enjoy both—that leads to great results.  
> 
> How can you combine your strength? That's something I would encourage everyone to think about. **You will find talented people in every area of life. It's the combinations that are rare.**



**References**
*Are there any quotes, books, or other content that comes to mind? Did you find the information somewhere?*

**Braindump, Summary, & Reference Notes**
*Write out everything that comes to mind. A summary in a way that you understand at this point in your life. Be sure to include the notes you took if you already took them.*

This reminds of a concept that I think Paul Grahm mentioned or is it from millionaire fastlane?
For example it is almost impossible to be a top 1% basketball player. You have to work extremely hard and better than 99% of the people in the world
However if you combine your strengths/skills there is less competietion. 


**Common Goals, Problems, & Advice**
*Everyone is working towards a goal, which one? What are the problems associated with those goals? What common advice is given to overcome those problems? This starts to frame our unique perspective.*

- Most people in life are told that they can be anything they want

**Personal Experience**
*What experiences, stories, or problems you’ve faced that come to mind?*

  - For example being the top 1% UI/UX Designer is hard because what can set me apart and make be stand out is to be a top 10% UI/UX Designer and top 10% Developer. There are much less people at this intersection which means there is less competition and makes it easier for me to stand out and succeed.
- 	 it is easier to stand out as an okay designer and developer than being the best designer or developer

**Potential Framework, System, or Solution**
*Can you create a memorable, step-by-step solution to solving the problem? You can flesh this out in your content. Be sure to add your own unique name to it!*
