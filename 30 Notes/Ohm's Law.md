Ohm's law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit. It states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the conductor and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor.

Mathematically, Ohm's law is expressed as:

V = I × R

where:
- V is the voltage, measured in volts (V)
	-  It represents the **force that pushes electric charges through a conductor** and is responsible for driving the current in an electrical circuit.
		- Water pressure
- I is the current, measured in amperes (A)
	- Current is the **flow of electric charge through a conductor**, such as a wire. It is the rate at which charge flows past a given point in an electrical circuit. (Flow of water through a pipe)
- R is the resistance, measured in ohms (Ω)\
	- Resistance is a measure of the **opposition to the flow of electric current** in a material or component
		- (narrowness or roughness of a pipe)

This equation can be rearranged to solve for current or resistance:

I = V ÷ R
R = V ÷ I
