## Sacrificing vs Maximizing
**Maximizing** is exploring all possible options and trying to get the best one.
**Sacrificing** is picking the first thing that fulfills those needs. (Pick the thing that is good enough)
While maximizing requires significant time and effort, it doesn't necessarily yield significantly better results than just choosing the first options that meets the essential requirements.
Maximizers often end up more unhappy with their jobs that satisfies. Maximizers are more regretful that ratifiers because they have endless expectations are always thought that they can do better.
