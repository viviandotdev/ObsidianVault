The "Generation Effect" suggests that **struggling to generate answers on your own, even if incorrect, enhances subsequent learning.**

**The Experiment**
Nate Kornell and psychologist Janet Metcalfe conducted an experiment with sixth graders in the South Bronx to explore the generation effect in the context of vocabulary learning. In that study, the researchers split students into 2 groups.
- In the first group the students were given the words with their definitions, e.g., "To discuss something in order to come to an agreement: Negotiate."
- In the second group the students were shown only the definitions and asked to guess the word before it was revealed.
When they were tested later, the second group, which had to come up with the words on their own performed  better.

**Being Wrong Helps you Learn**
An interesting discovery related to the generation effect is the "hypercorrection effect." This occurs when someone confidently remembers something incorrectly. The shock they feel when they realize their initial answer is incorrect, makes them more likely to remember the correct answer than the person who was originally unsure of their initial answer. **Essentially, being wrongâ€”and especially confidently wrongâ€”creates a powerful learning opportunity.**

**How to use this when you're learning**
1. **Pretesting**: Before you dive into a new topic, look for questions about what you're going to learn. Take a guess at the answers using what you already know. This approach primes your mind, settings the stage for absorbing new information.
2. **[[Active recall]]**: After you've studied something new, shut your book and see if you can recall what you just learned
