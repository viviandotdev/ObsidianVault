## People care more about ways to make themselves more lovable instead of focusing on learning how to love

Love should be active, it is like art it should require focus and dedication, it is something that you should build and be proud of the result.

**Resources**
[[our conception of love is messed up. - YouTube]]

**Common Problems/Personal Experience**
- I don't think I am good enough of a person to be in a relationship, therefore I must work on my self until I become a good enough person that some one will like
	- I no longer believe this is makes sense, I cannot just work on my self and hope that someone will like me

**Potential Framework, System, or Solution***
- In order to get into a relationship I need actually learn how to love not work on becoming more lovable
