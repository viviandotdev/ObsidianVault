## Success is not the result of any single quality, it’s about the alignment between who you are and where you choose to be.

**Alignment and Success**
Success is not the result of any single quality, it’s about the alignment between who you are and where you choose to be.

Types of alignment
Career Alignment: Find skills or activities that bring out your [[Signature strengths]]. (Right Skill, Right Role). Finding employment that aligns with your signature strengths creates an emotionally engaging force for achievement, meaning and happiness.

Relationship Alignment is the most important: Being connected to a group of friends and loved ones who help you become the person you want to be. Financial success is great, but to have a successful life we need happiness. Career success doesn’t always make us happy, but the research shows that happiness does bring success.
