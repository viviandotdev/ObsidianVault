## Productivity Tips
- **Schedule your daily to-do list,** it can be overwhelming to look at long list and feel like you need to get everything done that day
	- split them up into quick ticks, tasks, projects and schedule weekly
- Do you first priority task the first thing you do when you wake up.
- **“Make sure to get the important shit done”**
- **Realize how much time it takes you to do specific tasks**
	- Figure out how long it takes you to lose concentrations over each sector in tip #1 (1 hour and 30 minutes for focus) use the forest app
- **Mix in light and deep work into your day**
	- **Switch tasks**, whenever I feel my attention starting to fade.
- **Make your own deadlines**
- **Make a lot of lists**
	- I try to prioritize in a way that generates momentum.  The more I get done, the better I feel, and then the more I get done.  I like to **start and end each day with something I can really make progress on.**
	- When overwhelmed by a task make list.
	- list yearly, monthly, weekly and daily goals
	- break projects down into lists
		- write these lists down on paper, re transcribe them to think about them
- **Leave work slightly unfinished for easier flow the next day**
- **Time restriction**- set timers and restrict the time it takes for you to do any activity, because of  [[Parkinsons' Law]] without a limit we will take much longer than needed for something
	- for example I used not set a limit so then i would waste so much time at the gym because i said i could only leave if i finish this plan, however if i say you only have 50 minutes to complete this exercise, then i will try to do them faster to complete it or run faster to get in my miles.
- [[Protocol to Fight Distractions]]
- **The Recipe Method**
	- Write down exactly what you need to do down to the detailed steps, so you can turn your brain off and just execute.
	- Before a focus session write the recipe of exactly what you are going
