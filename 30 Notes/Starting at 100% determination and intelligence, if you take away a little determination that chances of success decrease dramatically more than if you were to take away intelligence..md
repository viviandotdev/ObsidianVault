Starting at 100% determination and intelligence, if you take away a little determination that chances of success decrease dramatically more than if you were to take away intelligence.Â 

In business Determination matters more then Intelligence (Donald Trump)

Determination is the desire and commitment to achieving a certain goal
Intelligence is intellectual, it is the ability to acquire new knowledge and skill quickly.

People with high intelligence may not have determination, although they can learn things quickly they do not have the ability to pursue them over long periods (years) or have the ability to continue learning when things get difficult.
People with high determination will continue to to work on something even if it gets hard they are more willing to push through the obstacles whereas people who are just intelligent with no determination would just give up.
