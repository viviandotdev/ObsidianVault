## The implications of artificial general intelligence

**Elon Musk was asked about what advice he would give his children regarding purpose and meaning in a world with artificial general intelligence. Elon Musk's response to the question was described as chilling, with a long silence and stuttering.**

It is interesting how what we initially thought about artificial intelligence was wrong. We thought that artificial intelligence would not be able to replace artists. However, it seems like are artists because of the success of Mid-journey were the ones impacted the most first. In addition, it seems like knowledge workers will also be highly impacted by artificial intelligence. In contrast, tradespeople such are Electricians and plumber seems to be the least impacted.
