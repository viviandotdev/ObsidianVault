Hey there!

This document is a place where I put down thoughts, data, experiences, and more that aim to help me understand myself better so I can line up my life with what I really want.

Hopefully it can be just as useful to you as it has been to me.

- **WHO IS MOM**
    - Grew up very poor
    - 3 older sisters and 1 older brother, (she is the youngest)
    - Dad died when she was in her 20s?
    - Moved to the US and met Dad
- **WHO IS Dad**
    - Grew up poor, Dad died
    - His older sisters became the head of the household and helped raise him.
    - When they had enough money he moved to the US first and was able to make money
    - He started working at a restaurant washing dishes.
    - Then he started being a Taxi driver,
    - Then my mom had some money for him to start his business
    - The bussiness was a success and he was able to make enough money to raise me my sister and my brother.
    
- **RIGHT / LEFT BRAIN**
    
    This is an incredible video that highlights how powerful the subconscious mind is. This guy had brain surgery and his right and left brains don’t talk to each other — just watch this [https://youtu.be/ZMLzP1VCANo?si=trBtR2zteHb1TcsY](https://youtu.be/ZMLzP1VCANo?si=trBtR2zteHb1TcsY)
    
- **PERSONALITY TEST RESULTS**
    There are a bunch of great personality tests but some that I took are:
    - [Human Design](https://www.myhumandesign.com/get-your-chart/)
    - [Enneagram](https://enneagramtest.com/quiz?afid=gdnens)
    - [Wealth Dynamics](https://www.wealthdynamics.com/)
    - [Myers Briggs / 16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) - INTJ
        - Introvert
            - Growing up, I only had one close friend during each main period of my life.
                - When I was really young, I think that was my sister
                - In elementary school, I had one friend from K-2nd grade, but she moved to Massachusetts.
                - From 3rd-5th grade, I was close with Abby.
                - From 6th-8th grade, I was close with Sharon.
                - From 9th-12th grade, I was basically alone and had no close friends.
                - In college, I made friends with my roommates and was close with Sandy and Chris.
            - I've always been very sensitive and probably have the [[SERT Gene]]. I remember crying a lot as a child because I got overwhelmed easily by arguments, raised voices, and expressions of disappointment or anger.
                - Mom and Dad thought solving the problem was just by yelling at me more, which I don't think solved the problem and just made me close off to them more.
                - Small things made me cry, like when my friends took my glasses in middle school, or when a girl kept hitting me with her hair in elementary school.
                - In 4th grade, I cried during a presentation because someone said they couldn't hear me.
            - I think these experiences taught me to hide my feelings and not express myself, which explains why I'm not very expressive and am closed off from others.
            - Socially, I'm very sensitive. A lot of people stress me out. In my college freshman year, I would get nosebleeds every night from meeting so many people. My face was always red, and my heart was always racing.
        - Thinking / Feeling
    
- **STRENGTHS**
    - Self explanatory. Anytime somebody complements you for something, not it down here.
- **WEAKNESSES**
    - Opposite as strengths.
- **THINGS I LIKED DOING AS A KID**
    - I loved to climb things, I remember going to central park and climbing on the all the rocks
    - I liked to build and design things, I liked playing minecraft and watching minecraft buld videos
    - 
- **MEMORIES FROM CHILDHOOD**
    - Always good to have a bank of your core memories.
- **WHERE DO I SPEND MY MONEY?**
    - A good indicator of what you value. Better indicator than what you tell people you value. You can lie, your bank account can’t.
- **HOW DO YOU VALUE MONEY?**
    - I want to spend as little time thinking about money as possible.
    - I want to build apps not to make a lot of money but because I enjoy it. I'm lucky to have found something I'm good at and enjoy, so why not spend more time doing it?
    - The goal is to continue building apps that I think are cool and that others will use. Salaries and money are byproducts of ambition, not the primary desire.
    - It's not that I don't care; I just don't want to fight. I know how things will be, and I'll end up getting hurt, so I give up and let you win. I'm scared of making you upset and will do anything to prevent that.
- **WHAT ARE THINGS THAT I WON’T SHUT UP ABOUT**
    - Another good indicator of things you’re in to.
- **MY FAVORITE BOOKS**
    - Creative Selection
    - The Psychology of Money
    - Crying in H Mart
    - I’m Glad my Mom Died
- **MY FAVORITE LEADERS**
    - A good indicator of communication styles you resonate with and the type of leader you’d want to be
- **PERSONAL SLOGANS / IDEAS / ICONS**
    - A fun one. A place to keep any catchphrases or slogans you have. Everybody should have some personal catchphrases.
- **MY FAVORITE MOVIES / TV SHOWS**
    - Interstellar
    - Tangled
    - WhipLash
    - Minari
    - Little Women
    - The Worst Person in the World
    - Everything Everywhere All AT Once
    - The Imitation Game
    - The Social Network
    - Your Name
    - The Wild Robot
    - Spider man into the spider verse
    - TWenty Five TWenty One
    - Arcane
- **ACTIVITIES AND PEOPLE THAT RECHARGE ME**
    - Take note here every time you do something that leaves you feeling recharged. Reference this note when you feel drained
- **ACTIVITIES AND PEOPLE THAT DRAIN OR DEPLETE ME**
    - Opposite as one above.
- **OBSERVATIONS / CONCLUSIONS**
    - What conclusions can you draw from all the info in this document about yourself?
- **SELF REFLECTIONS**
    - Things you’ve noticed about yourself
- **HOW I RESET**
    - Keep note of your reset rituals. What gets you back to center? Everyone is different. Keep note of what works for you
- **SHADOW WORK**
    - Go check out Carl Jung’s work — this is a whole different rabbit hole
- **LIMITING BELIEFS**
    
    Limiting beliefs or negative voices in our head seem to come from 1 of 3 places
    
    1. Extreme situations of the past, negative (i.e., trauma) or positive (i.e., an amazing emotional experience)
    2. Consistent conditioning from your environment meaning you hear and see it over and over again
    3. Impressions from the people you trusted most at a young age
    
    Jot yours down here so you are aware of them and can start to work on getting past them
    
- **PERFECT YEAR**
    - outline what the perfect year for you would look like
- **FAVORITE COMPLIMENTS I’VE RECEIVED**
    - A good indicator for the things that you value in yourself or that resonate with you. Keep note of them here.
