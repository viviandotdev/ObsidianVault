## Everyday is worth the same as any other What I did or didn’t do today doesn’t change its worth


Don’t you have things you want to do before you die?
Yet you’re not doing them right down
Even though you never know if you’ll drop dead tomorrow
That’s true for me just as much as for you
**Everyday is worth the same as any other**
**What I did or didn’t do today doesn’t change its worth**

I want to eat your pancreas
