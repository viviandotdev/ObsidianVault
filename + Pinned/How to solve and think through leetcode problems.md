# Observation -> Properties
[[Observation is the root of problem solving, new problems require to carefully study the properties]]
**Read and understand the problem statement**
- Read the problem and try to understand it
	- Chunk the problem into bits 
- Go through the examples the understand them
- Summarize the problem in your own words
**Identity key words and phrases**
- Go through the chunked problem, break it down, explain your though process for each chunk
	- Make concrete definitions
	- Identity any patterns that may help you solve this problem
	- What is possible?
	- What is not possible
	- ~~Tunnel vision~~ (Revisit your observations as needed)
**Identity directions of processing**
- Does the problem force you to go in a certain direction
- If any direction is good, which one is simplest or optimal


## Simulation
- **Pick an example and work through it**
	- Write down the decision/decisions
	- Pick a starting place based on your observations
	- Identity the actions that can be made
	- Identity the consequences of each decisions
	- Simulate the problem enough to gain structure
- **Replace values with variables**
	- Working with values allows to study 1 example
	- Working with variables allows to study an entire class of examples
**Build structure from your observations and ideas, and allow the solutions to reveal themselves**
Instead of guessing, work with generalized examples to figuring what technique you need 


# Write the Solution
- Build your solutions from your structured observations and ideas
