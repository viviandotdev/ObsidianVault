## Highlights
inertial mass and gravitational mass. Inertial mass is an object’s resistance to being accelerated by a force. More massive objects accelerate less than smaller objects given an identical force. Gravitational mass, on the other hand, relates to the amount of gravitational force experienced by an object. Objects with larger gravitational mass experience a larger gravitational force. — location: [165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FN37TI0&location=165) ^ref-35465

To add vectors A and B below, all you have to do is line them up so that the tip of the first vector touches the tail of the second vector. Then, to find the sum of the vectors, known as the resultant, draw a straight line from the start of the first vector to the end of the last vector. This method works with any number of vectors. — location: [399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FN37TI0&location=399) ^ref-767

You can start by rewriting the expression A - B as A + -B. Now it becomes an addition problem. You just have to figure out how to express -B. This is easier than it sounds. To find the opposite of a vector, just point the vector in the opposite direction. Therefore, you can use what we already know about the addition of vectors to find the resultant of A-B. — location: [402](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FN37TI0&location=402) ^ref-1242
