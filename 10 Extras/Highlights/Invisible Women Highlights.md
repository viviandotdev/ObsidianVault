# Invisible Women (Caroline Criado Perez)
## Highlights
'A powerful, important and eye-opening analysis of the gender politics of knowledge and ignorance' Cordelia Fine  'Press this into the hands of everyone you know. It is utterly brilliant!' Helena Kennedy  Imagine a world where your phone is too big for your hand, where your doctor prescribes a drug that is wrong for your body, where in a car accident you are 47% more likely to be seriously injured, where every week the countless hours of work you do are not recognised or valued. If any of this sounds familiar, chances are that you're a woman.Invisible Women shows us how, in a world largely built for and by men, we are systematically ignoring half the population. It exposes the gender data gap – a gap in our knowledge that is at the root of perpetual, systemic discrimination against women, and that has created a pervasive but invisible bias with a profound effect on women’s lives.Award-winning campaigner and writer Caroline Criado Perez brings together for the first time an impressive range of case studies, stories and new research from across the world that illustrate the hidden ways in which women are forgotten, and the impact this has on their health and well-being. From government policy and medical research, to technology, workplaces, urban planning and the media, Invisible Women reveals the biased data that excludes women. In making the case for change, this powerful and provocative book will make you see the world anew.Review"Invisible Women takes on the neglected topic of* what we don't *know - and why. The result is a powerful, important and eye-opening analysis of the gender politics of knowledge and ignorance. With examples from technology to natural disasters, this is an original and timely reminder of why we need women in the leadership of the institutions that shape every aspect of our lives.**" (Cordelia Fine)  "Hugely readable, packed with facts and insight. An important book written with humour and flair" (Robert Webb)  "The thoroughness of Invisible Women doesn’t detract from its absolute readability. This is entertaining, scholarly and so very important." (Adam Rutherford)  "Here are the facts! Caroline Criado Perez shines her penetrating gaze on the absence of women from the creation of most societal norms – from algorithms to medicinal doses to government policy. Knowledge is power – we all need to know how our systems work if we want change. Arm yourself with this book and press it into the hands of everyone you know. It is utterly brilliant! " (Helena Kennedy)  "Invisible Women is an absorbing cornucopia of thought-provoking facts - fascinating, alarming and face-palming in equal measures. Caroline Criado-Perez shows up the shortcomings of a world designed for men by men. The consequences of treating men as the default option, or women just as smaller men – if they get considered at all - has wide-reaching implications for everything (and everyone) from snow clearing to seat-belts and many branches of medicine. I shall certainly think of this book next time I have a heart attack, a car crash or just want to go to the toilet at the theatre." (Professor Gina Rippon)  "a blisteringly good book... never less than eye-opening, and frequently staggering" (The Bookseller)  "Wide-ranging and vastly well-informed, Invisible Women is a book that promises to transform the terms of the equality debate" (Sarah Ditum In the Moment, Books to Look Out for in 2019) About the Author

> It’s easy to slam phone manufacturers and social media platforms as sexist (and, as we shall see, they are, if often unknowingly), but the reality is that even if they had somehow managed to design an image of a ‘gender neutral’ runner, most of us would still have read that runner as male, because we read most things as male unless they are specifically marked as female.

> . Women do 75% of the world’s unpaid care work and this affects their travel needs. A typical female travel pattern involves, for example, dropping children off at school before going to work; taking an elderly relative to the doctor and doing the grocery shopping on the way home. This is called ‘trip-chaining’, a travel pattern of several small interconnected trips that has been observed in women around the world.

> Even after they were replaced by a machine, it took years before they were replaced by men. ENIAC, the world’s first fully functional digital computer, was unveiled in 1946, having been programmed by six women.57 During the 1940s and 50s, women remained the dominant sex in programming,58 and in 1967 Cosmopolitan magazine published ‘The Computer Girls’, an article encouraging women into programming.59 ‘It’s just like planning a dinner,’ explained computing pioneer Grace Hopper. ‘You have to plan ahead and schedule everything so that it’s ready when you need it. Programming requires patience and the ability to handle detail. Women are ‘naturals’ at computer programming.’

> But it was in fact around this time that employers were starting to realise that programming was not the low-skilled clerical job they had once thought. It wasn’t like typing or feeling. It required advanced problem-solving skills. And, brilliance bias being more powerful than objective reality (given women were already doing the programming, they clearly had these skills) industry leaders started training men. And then they developed hiring tools that seemed objective, but were actually covertly biased against women.

Perhaps it was that men’s were too high.

> Every year, 8,000 people die from work-related cancers.13 And although most research in this area has been done on men,14 it’s far from clear that men are the most affected.15 Over the past fifty years, breast-cancer rates in the industrialised world have risen significantly16 – but a failure to research female bodies, occupations and environments means that the data for exactly what is behind this rise is lacking.

> In nail salons, where the workforce is almost exclusively female (and often migrant), workers will be exposed on a daily basis to a huge range of chemicals that are ‘routinely found in the polishes, removers, gels, shellacs, disinfectants and adhesives that are staples of their work’.22 Many of these chemicals have been linked to cancer, miscarriages and lung diseases. Some may alter the body’s normal hormonal functions.

> Most of the research on chemicals has focused on their absorption through the skin.26 Leaving aside the problem that absorption through thicker male skin may not be the same as for women, skin is by no means the only way women working in nail salons will be absorbing these chemicals. Many of them are extremely volatile, which means that they evaporate into the air at room temperature and can be inhaled – along with the considerable amounts of dust produced when acrylic nails are filed. The research on how this may impact on workers is virtually non-existent.

> After a shift of paid work many of these women will then go home and begin a second unpaid shift, where they will be exposed to different chemicals that are ubiquitous in common cleaning products.23 The effects of these chemicals mixing together are largely unknown,24 although research does indicate that exposure to a mixture of chemicals can be much more toxic than exposure to chemicals on an individual basis.25

We need data that is separated and analysed by sex, and which includes reproductive status.35

Octaves on a standard keyboard are 7.4 inches wide, and one study found that this keyboard disadvantages 87% of adult female pianists.

But they can have the opposite effect if they don’t work – and often, they don’t work, at least for women

> When you’re sitting down, you’re still swaying. ‘If you’re sitting on a stool then you’re swaying around your hips,’ explains Stofcegen. ‘If your chair has a back, then your head is swaying on your neck. The only way to really get rid of that is to have a headrest and to use it,’ he adds. And I feel like one of those cartoon light bulbs has just gone off in my head. What if the headrest is at the wrong height, at the wrong angle, and the wrong shape to accommodate your body? Could women’s increased propensity to motion sickness in cars be exacerbated by cars being designed around the male body, I ask. ‘I think that’s quite possible, sure,’ Stoffregen replies.

Girls tend to present less as hyperactive and more as disorganised, scattered and introverted

> More broadly, researchers suggest that because women are socialised to ‘take turns in conversation, to downplay their own status, and to demonstrate behaviors that communicate more accessibility and friendliness’, the traditional medical interview model may be unsuccessful in getting the information from women that is needed to diagnose them effectively.54

> They also found that when male parents were told that a lower-pitched cry belonged to a boy, they rated the baby as in more discomfort than when the cry was labelled female.Instead of believing women when they say they’re in pain, we tend to label them as mad. And who can blame us?

> The full answer to these questions is beyond the scope of this book. But one possible explanation for at least part of the disparity is that women are being prescribed antidepressants when they are not in fact depressed.

> The Swedish study which found that men are more likely to report depression also found that women who have not reported depression are twice as likely as men to be prescribed antidepressants. This chimes with studies from the 1980s and 90s which found that while men who reported pain tended to receive pain medication, women were more likely to receive sedatives or antidepressants.66

But the system incentivises them so strongly – through lower taxes and access to certain tax credits – to file jointly that 96% of married couples do.22 And the result, in practice, is that most married women in the US get over-taxed on their income.
