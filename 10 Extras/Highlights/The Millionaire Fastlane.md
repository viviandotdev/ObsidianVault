[3] - The Road Trip to Wealth

Highlight(yellow) - Location 4879

All events of wealth are preceded by process, a backstory of trial, risk, hard work, and sacrifice. If you try to skip process, you’ll never experience events.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 5177

The person I needed to become would have been dwarfed because process would have been outsourced. There is no wisdom or personal growth gained in a journey that someone else does for you. The journey is yours. And unless you find like-minded Fastlaners, you will walk it alone.

[6] - Is Your Wealth Poisoned?

Highlight(yellow) - Location 7130

Wealth is not authored by material possessions, money, or “stuff,” but by what I call the three fundamental “F’s”: family (relationships), fitness (health), and freedom (choice). Within this wealth trinity is where you will find true wealth and, yes, happiness.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 7589

The long hours have disturbing clarity: Henry rarely “lives” at his dream home, and when he does, he spends it sleeping or recharging from the hustle of the work week. His relationship with his wife and kids suffers. His health declines as the stress of responsibility mount.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 7661

Foremost, The Millionaire Fastlane addresses the FREEDOM portion of the wealth trinity, because freedom offers protection to health and relationships. Only you can define your freedom and how you see your life.

[7] - Misuse Money and Money Will Misuse You

Highlight(yellow) - Location 7809

After basic needs are met (security, shelter, health, food), our happiness quotient is most significantly impacted by the quality of our relationships with our partners, our family, our friends, our spirituality, and ourselves.

money. The well-salaried workaholic who is never home to strengthen the relationship with his wife and kids is likely to be less happier than the poor farmer in Vietnam who spends half his day tending to his fields and the other half with his family.

Money buys the freedom to watch your kids grow up.

Highlight(blue) - Location 8080

➡ Money buys the freedom to pursue your craziest dreams. ➡ Money buys the freedom to make a difference in the world. ➡ Money buys the freedom to build and strengthen relationships. ➡ Money buys the freedom to do what you love, with financial validation removed from the equation.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 8233

Affordability is when you don’t have to think about it. If you have to think about “affordability,” you can’t afford it because affordability carries conditions and consequences.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 8317

Would you regret a gum purchase if you lost your job a week later? Or if your sales forecast was slashed by 50%? Nope, it wouldn’t make a difference. This is how affordability is measured against your level of wealth.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 8331

To overcome wealth impersonation, know what you can and can’t afford.

Ask yourself this: Which experience is more important? The experience of a menial

job designed to pay your bills? Or the experience (and failures) of creating something that could provide you financial freedom for a lifetime without ever having to hold a job again?

Exploding income and controlling expenses creates wealth.

Slowlane millionaires are cheap with money. Fastlane millionaires are cheap with time.

Bookmark - Location 16272

Highlight(yellow) - Location 17512

The Fastlane is about building a better system, a better contraption, a better product, or a better “something” that will leverage your work. In the Slowlane, you are the source of heavy lifting, while in the Fastlane, you construct a system that does it for you.

[17] - Switch Teams and Playbooks

Highlight(yellow) - Location 17802

And the irony of this producer/ consumer dichotomy? Once you succeed as a producer, you can consume anything you want with little consequence because you’ll be rich. To consume richly, produce richly first. Unfortunately, most people have it backward: consumption and no production. Producers get rich. Consumers get poor.

When you succeed as a producer, you can consume anything you want.

[21] - The Real Law of Wealth

Highlight(yellow) - Location 21541

The Law of Effection states that the more lives you affect in an entity you control, in scale and/ or magnitude, the richer you will become. The shortened, sanitized version is simply: Affect millions and make millions.

[23] - Life’s Steering Wheel

Highlight(yellow) - Location 23297

Your life’s steering wheel is a dangerous weapon. Three inches is all it takes. Jerk your life’s wheel three tiny inches while speeding and you can steer your life onto a path of no return, or worse, smack into a concrete wall. Like

If you’re younger than 30, your choices are at peak horsepower because they are growing the thick branches of your choice tree. Time to put the pedal to the metal!

You are exactly where you chose to be.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 23847

Choice is the most powerful control you have in your life.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 23853

Treasonous choices forever impact your life negatively.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 23862

The younger you are, the more potent your choices are and the more horsepower you possess.

[24] - Wipe Your Windshield Clean

Highlight(yellow) - Location 24330

Find the information, resources, and the people that align with the new beliefs. For myself, I pursued the stories of those who acquired wealth fast and soon learned that “Get Rich Quick” wasn’t a myth. I never found that 19-year-old who got rich piling money into indexed-funds. However, I did find 24-year-old millionaire inventors, business founders, authors, and website owners.

The universe has no memory, only you do.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 25140

➡ If your eyes are transfixed to the past, you can’t become the person you need to become in the future.

[26] - Your Primordial Fuel: Time

Highlight(yellow) - Location 25901

When anyone asks you to give your time, they’re really asking for

Highlight(yellow) - Location 25909

a chunk of your life.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 25944

These stories are common, and yet my reaction is the same: What the hell is wrong with people? I’ll tell you: These people value their time at zero. It’s free. Like the air we breathe, they’re convinced that time is abundant and in endless supply. They live as if they were immortal. They are certain that time, the fuel of their life, never runs empty.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 26205

The reality is that time is deathly scarce, while money is richly abundant.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 26667

Will this purchase TAKE FREEDOM? Will I own this or will it own me? While some choose servitude behind iron bars, others choose servitude behind velvet walls. Both are the same. The ultimate wealth is having the free time to live how you want to live.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 26787

Extreme inconvenience is never a match for saving money.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 26872

Fastlaners are frugal with time, while Slowlaners are frugal with money.

[28] - Hit the Redline

Highlight(yellow) - Location 29275

What prevents people from hitting the Redline? Someday does. Someday I will . . . someday I’ll do this, someday I’ll do that, someday when the kids are grown, someday when the debts are paid . . . someday. And yet, someday never comes. Someday is a distant horizon in the theater of your mind.

Failure is natural to success. Expect it and learn from it. ➡ One home run could set you financially secure for your life, perhaps generations.

[30] - The Commandment of Control

Highlight(yellow) - Location 30989

Take the producer’s role. The Fastlaner creates and invests in his own brand; the hitchhiker climbs aboard someone else’s and hopes to piggyback. If you don’t control your system, your money tree, and your brand, you control nothing. You must sit atop the pyramid and serve the masses.

[31] - The Commandment of Entry

Highlight(yellow) - Location 31454

When it comes to entry, your industry and your business should not be available to everyone, because if it is, you need to be exceptional. And if you are exceptional, easy entry becomes not a liability, but an asset.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 31562

If everyone is doing it, I won’t be doing it. I’ll exit the road, and you should too. Why? Because everyone isn’t wealthy. If everyone were wealthy, “everybody is doing it” would work.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 31576

When it comes to money, the best warning flag is “everyone.” Everyone is a red flag that the Commandment of Entry has been violated.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 31589

While “everyone” was buying houses like crazy during the housing boom, I did the opposite. I sat on the sidelines and sold. When the frenzy is buying, you should be selling. When the frenzy is selling, you should be buying or staying pat.

[32] - The Commandment of Need

Highlight(yellow) - Location 31828

What do we live for, if not to make life less difficult for each other?

Highlight(yellow) - Location 32093

Is there a need in my neighborhood for a martial arts studio? ✓ What are existing martial arts studios doing wrong that I could do better? ✓ What improved value do I offer the martial arts student?

However, if you ignore it and focus on what attracts the cat, it comes to you and sits in your lap.

It is attracted to businesses that solve problems. It’s attracted to people who fill needs and add value. Solve needs massively and money massively attracts.The amount of money in your life is merely a reflection to the amount of value you have given to others.

Make them look better (health, nutrition, clothing, makeup). ✓ Give them security (housing, safety, health). ✓ Raise a positive emotion (love, happiness, laughter, self-confidence). ✓ Satisfy appetites, from basic (food) to the risqué (sexual). ✓ Make things easier. ✓ Enhance their dreams and give hope.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 32540

For “do what you love” to work, you need two things: 1) Your love must solve a need and 2) You must be exceptional at

Highlight(yellow) - Location 32643

People pay for their satisfaction; they don’t pay to satisfy your need of “do what you love.” People pay for solutions, not for your enjoyment. People pay for solved problems. People don’t give a rats-ass about your love for whatever. If “do what you love” doesn’t fill a need spectacularly, no one will pay for

Highlight(yellow) - Location 32687

Now, I don’t need to get paid to “do what I love.” I just do it.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 32693

In other words, money led to “do what you love,” it didn’t follow.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 32899

The second danger of derivatives is that your love becomes vulnerable to contamination when you do it for money. If you are forced to do anything, even something you purport to love, in exchange for a paycheck, that love is put in danger.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 33074

I want to pay off my mother’s mortgage. I want to wake up without an alarm clock. I want to write a book without the pressure of money. I want a big house on a mountainside with a pool. I want a Lamborghini. I want to make a difference. I want to prove him wrong.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 33696

Help one million people and you will be a millionaire.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 33717

When you have the financial resources, you can “do what you love” and not get paid for it, nor do you have to be good at it.

[34] - The Commandment of Scale

Highlight(yellow) - Location 34270

Billionaire Mark Cuban recently wrote on his blog that it doesn’t matter how many times you strike out in business because you only have to be right once, and that “once” can set you up for life. In other words, be in the business of home runs.

Inventing is still recognized as the default get-rich-quick method out there, and yes, it is alive and well. However, don’t be fooled. Inventing isn’t really about inventing the vehicle, the telephone, or the goofy Segway—the core inventing activity is just taking something and improving or modifying it. Take something old and stale and make it better. Take an underexposed product, make it your own, and reintroduce it to the world. Take something unconventional and make it conventional.

If you can’t see the opportunities that surround you, you haven’t tuned your Fastlane frequency to them.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 36241

Many entrepreneurs misinterpret opportunity because they associate opportunity with breakthrough, legendary ideas. They seek virgin ideas, perfect and new; ones that would be unveiled to the world in grandiose events. Rarely does that happen.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 36263

Opportunity is a solution to an inconvenience. Opportunity is simplification. Opportunity is a feeling. Opportunity is comfort. Opportunity is better service. Opportunity is fixing pain. Opportunity is putting weak companies out of business.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 36283

“Someone is doing it” is a monumental illusion imposing as an impassable obstacle. Someone is always already doing it.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 36371

Successful businesses rarely evolve from some legendary idea.

Highlight(yellow) - Location 36380

Skip the big idea and go for the big execution. You don’t need an idea that has never been done before. Old ideas suffice; just take it and do it better! Execute like no one has!

If Company X does something and you react, you are being reactive, not proactive. Why aren’t they following your lead? If your preoccupation is with every single thing your competition does, you’re cheating your business and your customers.

Don’t confuse “passion” with “do what you love.” Passion burns your soul and drives you to do whatever it takes. Passion revs you with excitement and enrages you with discontent. Some passions are selfish (I want a Lamborghini) and other passions are selfless (I want to help orphaned children). It doesn’t matter what it is, as long as the passion burns hot enough to burn a hole in your pants and gets you stoked for process.

One tiny property isn’t going to make you rich, but 200 accumulated over the years might. Accumulation doesn’t happen in a few short years, but many. I never met a 22-year-old multimillionaire real estate investor simply because it is a slower Fastlane with asset values that cannot be manipulated as easily as your own self-created business. Asset value is limited by magnitude, which is why the richest real estate investors are not only older, but they focus on high-dollar properties. Real estate possesses an excellent detachment component that survives time.

Remember, you aren’t just a dental hygienist; you’re a mother, a woman, and a daughter. There are hundreds of roads in those subsets. What are you passionate about? Politics? Natural living?

Yes. Get in business for the right reason, and the right reason is to fill a void in the marketplace or to do something better than anyone else. Business becomes risky when entrepreneurs start companies based on flawed, selfish motives. Remember, strangers don’t care about your dreams and we’re inherently selfish. Risk is escalated when you get into business without a defined need, brand, or purpose. Risk is escalated when you get into business doing what you love versus doing what needs to be done.

Yes, when it comes to my financial plan I’m a control freak, and you should be as well. If you aren’t in control, then you’re dependent on someone else for your comfort and security.

A skewed value attribute could be better ingredients, better delivery, better customer service, better packaging, better user interface, better website, better functionality, better this, better that. Skew two or three value attributes and you have yourself a business. I detail this process in my newer book, Unscripted.
