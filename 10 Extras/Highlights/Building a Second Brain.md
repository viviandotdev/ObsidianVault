## Building a Second Brain
- Author: Tiago Forte
## Highlights
By training ourselves to notice when something resonates with us, we can improve not only our ability to take better notes, but also our understanding of ourselves and what makes us tick. It is a way of turning up the volume on our intuition so we can hear the wisdom it offers us.

---
When something resonates, it moves you on an intuitive level. Often, the ideas that resonate are the ones that are most unusual, counterintuitive, interesting, or potentially useful.

---
. Because our priorities and goals can change at a moment’s notice, and probably will, we want to avoid organizing methods that are overly rigid and prescriptive. The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?”

---
Surprisingly, when you focus on taking action, the vast amount of information out there gets radically streamlined and simplified. There are relatively few things that are actionable and relevant at any given time, which means you have a clear filter for ignoring everything else.

---
Every time you take a note, ask yourself, “How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?” That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention.

---
What is the point of knowledge if it doesn’t help anyone or produce anything?IV Whether your goal is to lose weight, get a promotion at work, start a side business, or strengthen your local community, personal knowledge management exists to support taking action—anything else is a distraction.

---
A common challenge for people who are curious and love to learn is that we can fall into the habit of continuously force-feeding ourselves more and more information, but never actually take the next step and apply it. We compile tons of research, but never put forward our own proposal. We gather untold business case studies, but never pitch one potential client. We study every piece of relationship advice available, but never ask anyone out on a date.

---
 Information becomes knowledge—personal, embodied, verified—only when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it’s just a theory.

---
This practice continues among creatives today. Songwriters are known for compiling “hook books” full of lyrics and musical riffs they may want to use in future songs. Software engineers build “code libraries” so useful bits of code are easy to access

Highlights: Insightful passages from books or articles you read.Quotes: Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks you listen to.Bookmarks and favorites: Links to interesting content you find on the web or favorited social media posts.

---
Voice memos: Clips recorded on your mobile device as “notes to self.”Meeting notes: Notes you take about what was discussed during meetings or phone calls.Images: Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting.Takeaways: Lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you’ve attended.

---
Stories: Your favorite anecdotes, whether they happened to you or someone else.Insights: The small (and big) realizations you have.Memories: Experiences from your life that you don’t want to forget.Reflections: Personal thoughts and lessons written in a journal or diary.Musings: Random “shower ideas” that pop into your head.

Here are more examples of favorite problems from my students:

---
Resources: Things I Want to Reference in the Future

---
Areas: What I’m Committed to Over Time

PARA isn’t a filing system; it’s a production system. It’s no use trying to find the “perfect place” where a note or file belongs. There isn’t one. The whole system is constantly shifting and changing in sync with your constantly changing life.

---
I’ve learned that completed creative projects are the blood flow of your Second Brain. They keep the whole system nourished, fresh, and primed for action. It doesn’t matter how organized, aesthetically pleasing, or impressive your notetaking system is. It is only the steady completion of tangible wins that can infuse you with a sense of determination, momentum, and accomplishment. It doesn’t matter how small the victories.

They had repeatedly postponed their creative ambitions to some far-off, mythical time when somehow everything would be perfectly in order. Once we set that aside and just focused on what they actually wanted to do right now, they suddenly gained a tremendous sense of clarity and motivation.For a while I was sure this would come back to haunt me. Eventually they’d want to go back and organize all those old files, right? I would often see the same people coming back to our store again and again. I waited expectantly in fear for someone to return and accuse me of losing all their old files.Let me tell you: no one ever did.

Here’s some examples of projects my students have come up with:

Distillation is at the very heart of all effective communication. The more important it is that your audience hear and take action on your message, the more distilled that message needs to be. The details and subtleties can come later once you have your audience’s attention.

of Progressive Summarization:II

---
To enhance the discoverability of this note, I need to add a second layer of distillation. I usually do this when I have free time during breaks or on evenings or weekends, when I come across the note while working on other projects, or when I don’t have the energy for more focused work. All I have to do is bold the main points within the note.

---
There is one more layer we can add, though it is quite rarely needed. For only the very few sources that are truly unique and valuable, I’ll add an “executive summary” at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words. The best sign that a fourth layer is needed is when I find myself visiting a note again and again, clearly indicating that it is one of the cornerstones of my thinking. 

---
The answer is that you should do it when you’re getting ready to create something.

---
Instead, wait until you know how you’ll put the note to use. For example, when I’m preparing to write a blog post or article, I’ll usually start by highlighting the most interesting points from a group of notes that I think will be relevant to the topic at hand.

---
Don’t leave your home without a notebook, paper scraps, something to write with.Don’t walk into the world without your eyes and ears focused and open.Don’t make excuses about what you don’t have or what you would do if you did, use that energy to “find a way, make a way.”

hlighting paragraph after paragraph or entire pages of textbooks in the vain hope that you’d automatically be able to remember everything in yellow for the test.When it comes to notetaking for work, less is more. You can capture entire books, article

Favorites or bookmarks saved from the web or social mediaJournal or diary entries with your personal reflectionsHighlights or underlined passages in books or articlesMessages, photos, or videos posted on social mediaSlides or charts included in presentationsDiagrams, mind maps, or other visuals on paper or in appsRecordings of meetings, interviews, talks, or presentationsAnswers to common questions you receive via emailWritten works, such as blog posts or white papersDocumented plans and processes such as agendas, checklists, templates, or project retrospectives

Our creativity thrives on examples. When we have a template to fill in, our ideas are channeled into useful forms instead of splattered around haphazardly. There are best practices and plentiful models for almost anything you might want to make.
