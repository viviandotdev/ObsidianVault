## We are responsible for our own emotions

**We are responsible for our own emotions.** You can't make it someone else's fault for you feeling frustrated. They are doing what they are doing, and you are the one feeling the frustration.
I don't have the ability to regulate how you think and feel, l therefore if you're frustrated it is not my fault.
