## Responding to conflicts in relationships

- Don’t show them evidence that conflicts with what they believe.
	- During conflicts, the area of the brain associated with logic shutdown and the regions associated with aggression light up. The brain is no longer processing what's being said it is just trying to win.
- Explaining is just veiled dominance, you are not trying to educate, dupe down you’re still trying to win. All the other side hears when you explain is “Here’s why I am right, and you are wrong”.
- Ask questions so that can come up with a solution on their own. They don’t have to surrender and admit that “you’re right”. If they come up with their own solution they are less defensive.
	- What would you like me to do?
- Listen and respond to their emotions, “sounds like you’re angry or you're sad”. usually they are upset and want to heard.
