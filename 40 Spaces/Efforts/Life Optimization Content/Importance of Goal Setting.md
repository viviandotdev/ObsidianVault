## Importance of Goal Setting

You need to pick something on the horizon and go towards it or else you will just walk in circles
There is this study were they put people in a forest with any direction and told then to walk in a straight line and they literally ended up walking in circles unless given a external reference point.
This is why it is important to choose goals, goals are like an external reference point, it gives you a place to go towards or else you will spend years going in circles doing the same things and not making any progress.
It is not the goal, just pick a direction of where you want to go, or else you will go in circles for years and move towards to figuring things out
