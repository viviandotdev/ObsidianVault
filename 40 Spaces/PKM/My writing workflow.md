How do you find questions or ideas, through consumption and things?
There is so much information in the world and so little time so only spend time on things you find interesting. there is not enough time to learn everything so only learn what is interesting to you and contsaly be filtering out what is not important to you
	look for a video, read the sources to find
**Both Robert Greene and Ryan Holiday do This**
“I read a book, very carefully, writing on the margins with all kinds of notes. A few weeks later I return to the book, and transfer my scribbles on to note cards, each card representing an important theme in the book.”

****Books also contain footnotes, little scribbles most of us ignore. These footnotes contain resources with more information about what you just read. It backtracks the author’s path that led him or her onto this conclusion, and it might lead you to a different one too.**

1. Find a question or topic you are interested in 
	From books, movies, tv show,  blogs and other youtube video
	 Assess the ideas
2. Research- Find 3-5 books on the topic
		Skim each book and highlight the relevant and interesting sections
		From the highlights create an outline. (10-20. pages)


Writing non function-
	write about how something works
Sm the books and write an essay on it

[A Writing Process](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/my-writing-process/)
**Build a big document from all the books:**
1. **Big Document Creation:**
   - Begin by compiling every idea in my head into a single document, resulting in 50-100 pages of notes.
2. **Creating Mini Documents:**
   - Analyze the big document to group related ideas, forming 10 to 20 smaller, more focused documents.
3. **Ordering the Documents:**
   - Once categorized into smaller documents, arrange them in a logical sequence. This step forms the preliminary outline.
4. **Developing a Master Outline:**
   - With a clear sequence established, create a master outline. This entails making one comprehensive list of all topics, arranged in the correct order.
5. **Outlines within Outlines:**
   - Delve into each of the smaller documents to create detailed outlines for them. These detailed outlines serve as the blueprints for individual chapters.
6. **Initiating the Writing Process:**
   - Start writing without further delay. This phase is crucial as it helps in finding one's voice, refining the outline, and overcoming the intimidation of starting from scratch.
