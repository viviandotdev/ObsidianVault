### My Perspectives
[[My unique perspective workflow]]


[[happiness]]
- [[Freedom and flexility over oneâ€™s life is the best predictor of wellbeing]]
- [[You are happiest when working towards your goals, not when you have achieved them]]
- [[You need 3 hobbies, one that keeps you healthy, one that earns you money and one to be creative]]

[[learning]]
- [[Learning how to learning is the ultimate skill that will give you the power to do what you love]]
- [[Learning is one of the most pleasurable experiences in life]]
- [[When you learn something new, learn it as if you are going to explain it someone in the next 48 hours]]
- [[You have to do it incorrectly first to figure out how to do it correctly]]
	- [[You must write bad code before you can write good code.]]
	- [[You must write badly before you can learn to write well]]

[[success]]
- [[Being successful creates more success]]
- [[It is not that hard to be successful because most of people are distracted on their phones or TVs ]]
- [[Nothing happens then everything happens]]
- [[It is not the people who make the best decisions that are the most successful it the ones to make the most decisions and continuously iterate on those decisions.]]
- [[if you want to do something right, do it yourself, because other people don't care enough.]]
- [[Combining different strengths sets you apart and leads to exceptional results by creating are opportunities.]]
- [[Intrinsic motivation is the result of commitment rather than passion]]

[[money]]
- [[Time is limited but money is abundant, make sure to spend your time wisely]]
- [[Money is a required pursuit for life but a pointless pursuit upon death]]

[[life]]
- [[Life is suffering, but you can choose how you suffer]]
- [[Life is a game]]
- [[Validate everything you learn through experimentation on your own life]]

[[confidence]]
- [[Past progress is proof of future potential]]

[[productivity]]
- [[Productivity Tips]]

[[relationships]]
- [[Investing life energy into controllable aspects, such as personal interests and goals, is a smarter choice than pursuing a relationship, which is not entirely within your control. ]]
- [[I am even not even close to where I want to be in life to sacrifice that time into something outside of myself]]

[[love]]
- [[You can tell how much you love yourself based on the partner you choose]]
