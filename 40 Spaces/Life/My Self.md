### Why am I introverted?
- Growing up, I only had one close friend during each main period of my life.
  - When I was really young, I think that was my sister
  - In elementary school, I had one friend from K-2nd grade, but she moved to Massachusetts.
  - From 3rd-5th grade, I was close with Abby.
  - From 6th-8th grade, I was close with Sharon.
  - From 9th-12th grade, I was basically alone and had no close friends.
  - In college, I made friends with my roommates and was close with Sandy and Chris.
- I've always been very sensitive and probably have the [[SERT Gene]]. I remember crying a lot as a child because I got overwhelmed easily by arguments, raised voices, and expressions of disappointment or anger.
  - Mom and Dad thought solving the problem was just by yelling at me more, which I don't think solved the problem and just made me close off to them more.
  - Small things made me cry, like when my friends took my glasses in middle school, or when a girl kept hitting me with her hair in elementary school.
  - In 4th grade, I cried during a presentation because someone said they couldn't hear me.
- I think these experiences taught me to hide my feelings and not express myself, which explains why I'm not very expressive and am closed off from others.
- Socially, I'm very sensitive. A lot of people stress me out. In my college freshman year, I would get nosebleeds every night from meeting so many people. My face was always red, and my heart was always racing.

### Why don't i feel lonely?
- I have felt more lonely around other people than when I'm alone.
- The most lonely period of my life was high school.
- I never get bored because I have so many questions, books I want to read, and things I want to build and learn. I get confused when people say they are bored.
- The immense computational power and energy required to develop semi-intelligent systems like ChatGPT are staggering. Yet, our brains naturally possess incredible cognitive capabilities, which we often take for granted. Instead of harnessing this potential, many people spend their time mindlessly scrolling through TikTok or watching TV, allowing their brains to atrophy rather than using them to their fullest extent.

### Why I quit social media
- I don't feel FOMO because I know I wouldn't want to be in those situations. If you show me someone having fun at a party, I don't feel FOMO because I know I wouldn't have fun there.
- Social media tells you what to like, think, and feel, but I want to figure these things out naturally. I want to know what I'll become interested in on my own.

### How do you value money?
- I want to spend as little time thinking about money as possible.
- I want to build apps not to make a lot of money but because I enjoy it. I'm lucky to have found something I'm good at and enjoy, so why not spend more time doing it?
- The goal is to continue building apps that I think are cool and that others will use. Salaries and money are byproducts of ambition, not the primary desire.
- It's not that I don't care; I just don't want to fight. I know how things will be, and I'll end up getting hurt, so I give up and let you win. I'm scared of making you upset and will do anything to prevent that.
- I usually don't spend much money


### Which attachment style are you?
**Suppression of Emotion**
You describe a childhood where expressing emotions, whether joy or sadness, was often met with punishment or dismissal. Examples include being yelled at for laughing loudly or crying, which taught you to suppress your feelings. This led to a belief that emotions were a source of trouble, and you learned to avoid them to cope. **This suppression seems to have made it difficult to be vulnerable and communicate openly in relationships as an adult.**  I couldn't express myself the way I wanted, only in a way that fit how my mom wanted me to represent her.
**Inconsistent and Unresponsive Parenting**
You've highlighted several instances of inconsistent and emotionally unresponsive parenting. You mentioned feeling emotionally abandoned, especially by your dad, **who was often absent for important events.** The inconsistency of being loved one moment and criticized the next was confusing and created an environment where you felt it was unsafe to share your hopes and dreams. This also extended to your physical needs, such as your freezing room in the winter, which were ignored.
**Attachment and Relationships**
These early experiences appear to have shaped your attachment style. You related your feelings of being "abandoned" immediately after birth to your struggles with forming close, secure relationships and your difficulty trusting others. You identified with an avoidant attachment style, noting how you might push people away to prevent being abandoned yourself. This also connects to your observations about your parents' poor communication and lack of respect for each other's opinions, which didn't provide a healthy model for you to learn from.

**Long-Term Effects**
 * Difficulty managing emotions or feeling a heightened sensitivity to stress.
 * A sense of emotional numbness, where you feel no pain, which you believe is a coping mechanism.
 * A feeling of not being close to your parents or anyone else.
 * A belief that you must figure everything out yourself because no one will help you.


**Early Separation and Attachment**
You believe your attachment issues stem from being raised by your aunts instead of your parents during crucial early years. You feel this period is essential for brain development and forming deep connections, and you believe you missed out on that "wiring." This has led to a feeling of being emotionally disconnected from your parents, to the point where you could live your life without them.
**The Feeling of Something Missing**
You have a strong sense that a part of your brain or emotional self is missing. While you don't know exactly what this is, you are certain something isn't right. This feeling of an emotional void is a key part of your struggle, and it is a direct result of your early childhood experiences.
**A Desire to Reconnect**
Despite these challenges, you express a desire to "remake those connections." This shows an awareness that these issues can be addressed. However, you are unsure how to begin this process, which highlights a feeling of being lost or uncertain about the path forward. Your fear of losing relationships is also a strong indicator that you want to form secure connections, even if you don't know how to do so yet.

**[[emotional detachment]]**


- I would cry when my mom forced me to wear a dress. We argued about her forcing me to wear things that made me uncomfortable. I couldn't express myself the way I wanted, only in a way that fit how my mom wanted me to represent her.
- - Avoidant people fear being abandoned. I think everyone fears this, but we cope differently.
- Anxious people overthink and stress about it.
-  Early separation from parents can affect attachment styles. You might find it challenging to form secure attachments in relationships, potentially leading to issues with trust or intimacy.
- Avoidant push people away or keep them at a distance to abandon the other person before they can be abandoned.
- I think this subconsciously comes from my childhood. I was "abandoned" by my parents immediately after birth, which is crucial for forming secure relationships. I still don't feel close to my parents or anyone.
- I expressed my wants and needs and was immediately shut down, realizing I had to figure everything out myself because they wouldn't help me.
- My sister and mom were dismissive. For example, every winter, my room was freezing, and I would wake up shivering. I told my dad and sister, but I was ignored.
- Maybe that's why I feel no pain; I blocked it out to cope. It's easier to suffer if you don't feel pain.
- My parents were focused on themselves and didn't attune to my emotions, making it hard to be vulnerable.
- I didn't see adults clearly communicate, work through issues, or respect each other's differences of opinion. Mom and Dad didn't communicate well or respect each other's differences.
- Even now, their differences of opinion about money aren't healthy. Mom makes me talk to Dad instead of talking to him herself.
- I grew up in a home where nothing was ever talked about, and everything was ignored or swept under the rug. As an adult, I learned not to express my emotions. When I did, I was dismissed, told to stop being dramatic, or even punished.
- For example, every time I cried or displayed emotion, I was punished and yelled at for crying. This is why I learned to avoid my emotions and choose to suppress them. Running away from emotions makes relationships more difficult.
- **Emotional abandonment** and **inconsistency** in feeling validated and loved. My dad never showed up for me. He wasn't there for birthdays, piano performances, or awards. He rarely came home for dinner.
- Inconsistent parenting: **Some days, they love and care for you; other days, they criticize you**
- Parents who criticize create children who no longer share their hopes and dreams because they'll be knocked down.
- **Hitting your kids falls under inconsistent parenting.** As a child, you may not understand how someone who loves you could want to hurt you. It's confusing for a kid.
- You're also inconsistent sometimes. Sometimes you seem to like me, but other times, you don't.
- **Emotionally immature parents view children as a source of their self-esteem.**
-  Early childhood experiences play a crucial role in developing emotional regulation skills. You might experience difficulties in managing emotions or heightened sensitivity to stress.

### What do you think is most important: health, time, or money?
- I think one of the keys to living a good life is optimizing for health, time, and money.


  
### Why i love to rock climb?
If the person that’s supposed love me the most doesn’t even believe in me or encourage me to do well how can I supposed to believe in myself.
I had such low self-esteem, I doubted my self so much and the people who were supposed to love me the most did not make it any easier. 

Like I see it with my brother, like the other day he told me he wanted to a piano so he practice a song he liked,

I told him he could have mine, and my mom and sister said don’t give to him it’s a waste of time he’s just going to practice for 2 days and then give up, I was the only trying to encourage, like I as showing him songs like.

Also like I recently got him to start cooking and he cooked fried rice and it came out mushy, granted it was my fault because I thew in the vegetables in after he cooked it, but that was because he wasn't going to put any in and wanted vegetables.
My sister looked at it and said I could even mess it up if i tried.
Then my mom throws out the leftovers when I wanted to eat it,
Like how do you expect anyone to be good if you don't encourage them.
I've learned to not listen to them when they see things, like they doubt me all the fucking time it actually so annoying. Like how many times do I have to prove them wrong for them to believe in me.

Like when I got my job I didn't have anyone to tell, 
### What makes me happy
- eating sushi 
- toping out on a difficult bouldering
- eating good food with friends
- watching devil's plan
