# Self Analysis

### Why am I introverted?
- Growing up, I only had one close friend during each main period of my life.
  - When I was really young, I think that was my sister
  - In elementary school, I had one friend from K-2nd grade, but she moved to Massachusetts.
  - From 3rd-5th grade, I was close with Abby.
  - From 6th-8th grade, I was close with Sharon.
  - From 9th-12th grade, I was basically alone and had no close friends.
  - In college, I made friends with my roommates and was close with Sandy and Chris.
- I've always been very sensitive and probably have the [[SERT Gene]]. I remember crying a lot as a child because I got overwhelmed easily by arguments, raised voices, and expressions of disappointment or anger.
  - Mom and Dad thought solving the problem was just by yelling at me more, which I don't think solved the problem and just made me close off to them more.
  - Small things made me cry, like when my friends took my glasses in middle school, or when a girl kept hitting me with her hair in elementary school.
  - In 4th grade, I cried during a presentation because someone said they couldn't hear me.
- I think these experiences taught me to hide my feelings and not express myself, which explains why I'm not very expressive and am closed off from others.
- Socially, I'm very sensitive. A lot of people stress me out. In my college freshman year, I would get nosebleeds every night from meeting so many people. My face was always red, and my heart was always racing.

**Why don't I feel lonely?**
- I have felt more lonely around other people than when I'm alone.
- The most lonely period of my life was high school.
- I never get bored because I have so many questions, books I want to read, and things I want to build and learn. I get confused when people say they are bored.
- The immense computational power and energy required to develop semi-intelligent systems like ChatGPT are staggering. Yet, our brains naturally possess incredible cognitive capabilities, which we often take for granted. Instead of harnessing this potential, many people spend their time mindlessly scrolling through TikTok or watching TV, allowing their brains to atrophy rather than using them to their fullest extent.

**Why I quit social media**
- I don't feel FOMO because I know I wouldn't want to be in those situations. If you show me someone having fun at a party, I don't feel FOMO because I know I wouldn't have fun there.
- Social media tells you what to like, think, and feel, but I want to figure these things out naturally. I want to know what I'll become interested in on my own.

**How do you value money?**
- I want to spend as little time thinking about money as possible.
- I want to build apps not to make a lot of money but because I enjoy it. I'm lucky to have found something I'm good at and enjoy, so why not spend more time doing it?
- The goal is to continue building apps that I think are cool and that others will use. Salaries and money are byproducts of ambition, not the primary desire.
- It's not that I don't care; I just don't want to fight. I know how things will be, and I'll end up getting hurt, so I give up and let you win. I'm scared of making you upset and will do anything to prevent that.

**Why am I so avoidant?**
- Avoidant people fear being abandoned. I think everyone fears this, but we cope differently.
- Anxious people overthink and stress about it.
-  Early separation from parents can affect attachment styles. You might find it challenging to form secure attachments in relationships, potentially leading to issues with trust or intimacy.
- Avoidant push people away or keep them at a distance to abandon the other person before they can be abandoned.
- I think this subconsciously comes from my childhood. I was "abandoned" by my parents immediately after birth, which is crucial for forming secure relationships. I still don't feel close to my parents or anyone.
- I expressed my wants and needs and was immediately shut down, realizing I had to figure everything out myself because they wouldn't help me.
- My sister and mom were dismissive. For example, every winter, my room was freezing, and I would wake up shivering. I told my dad and sister, but I was ignored.
- Maybe that's why I feel no pain; I blocked it out to cope. It's easier to suffer if you don't feel pain.
- My parents were focused on themselves and didn't attune to my emotions, making it hard to be vulnerable.
- I didn't see adults clearly communicate, work through issues, or respect each other's differences of opinion. Mom and Dad didn't communicate well or respect each other's differences.
- Even now, their differences of opinion about money aren't healthy. Mom makes me talk to Dad instead of talking to him herself.
- I grew up in a home where nothing was ever talked about, and everything was ignored or swept under the rug. As an adult, I learned not to express my emotions. When I did, I was dismissed, told to stop being dramatic, or even punished.
- For example, every time I cried or displayed emotion, I was punished and yelled at for crying. This is why I learned to avoid my emotions and choose to suppress them. Running away from emotions makes relationships more difficult.
- Emotional abandonment and inconsistency in feeling validated and loved. My dad never showed up for me. He wasn't there for birthdays, piano performances, or awards. He rarely came home for dinner.
- Inconsistent parenting: **Some days, they love and care for you; other days, they criticize you**. Parents who criticize create children who no longer share their hopes and dreams because they'll be knocked down.
- Hitting your kids falls under inconsistent parenting. As a child, you may not understand how someone who loves you could want to hurt you. It's confusing for a kid.
- You're also inconsistent sometimes. Sometimes you seem to like me, but other times, you don't.
- Emotionally immature parents view children as a source of their self-esteem.
-  Early childhood experiences play a crucial role in developing emotional regulation skills. You might experience difficulties in managing emotions or heightened sensitivity to stress.

**Which attachment style are you?**
- I relate to this growing up. As a kid, I was very expressive. I remember dancing in my room and laughing a lot.
- I often got yelled at for being too loud or expressive. When I cried, I was told to stop crying and expressing myself.
- I remember watching Disney Channel shows and cackling, but my mom would get mad and yell at me for laughing too loud.
- I would cry when my mom forced me to wear a dress. We argued about her forcing me to wear things that made me uncomfortable. I couldn't express myself the way I wanted, only in a way that fit how my mom wanted me to represent her.

**What do you think is most important: health, time, or money?**
- I think one of the keys to living a good life is optimizing for health, time, and money.


  
**Why i love to rock climb?**
If the person that’s supposed love me the most doesn’t even believe in me or encourage me to do well how can I supposed to believe in myself.
I had such low self-esteem, I doubted my self so much and the people who were supposed to love me the most did not make it any easier. 

Like I see it with my brother, like the other day he told me he wanted to a piano so he practice a song he liked,

I told him he could have mine, and my mom and sister said don’t give to him it’s a waste of time he’s just going to practice for 2 days and then give up, I was the only trying to encourage, like I as showing him songs like.

Also like I recently got him to start cooking and he cooked fried rice and it came out mushy, granted it was my fault because I thew in the vegetables in after he cooked it, but that was because he wasn't going to put any in and wanted vegetables.
My sister looked at it and said I could even mess it up if i tried.
Then my mom throws out the leftovers when I wanted to eat it,
Like how do you expect anyone to be good if you don't encourage them.
I've learned to not listen to them when they see things, like they doubt me all the fucking time it actually so annoying. Like how many times do I have to prove them wrong for them to believe in me.


Like when I got my job I didn't have anyone to tell,
