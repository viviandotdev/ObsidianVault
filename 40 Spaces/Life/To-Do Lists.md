## To-Do Lists
 Researchers showed that writing your daily list the **evening before** helps you accomplish them the next day. If you don’t write them down, they will take the valuable slots of memory.
- Plan your finishing time, this is as important as planning your working time.
- Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it’s only one pomodoro.
- Take notes about what works and what doesn’t.
- Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.

**Effective to-do lists are limited to specific tasks that can be tackled right away and finished fairly soon, Ms. Morgenstern says. Instead of listing “solve client issue,” write, “spend one hour defining the scope of client problem.”**

3-2-1 (priority of tasks)
(3 hours on 1st most important task)
(2 hours on the 2nd most important task)
(1 hour on the 3rd most important task)
