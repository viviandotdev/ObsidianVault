## Values

- I don’t believe in anger anymore.
	- I don't believe in getting angry, i think anger shows a lack of control over your own emotions. Often getting angry hurts another individual emotionally or physically which is not some thing i want to do. I’ve always been the one who has been hurt my other people’s anger, I know how much pain and how much sucks to receive someone else’s anger so I know that I would never want to make someone feel that way which is why I don’t get angry


- I don’t believe in any short-term thinking or dealing.
- I believe in honesty and being my true self. I want to put my self in environments where I can be honest with my self. I want to be able to be myself and can act without filtering my actions or words. I don’t want to be around people that I can’t be fully honest with 
- I think it is better to assume the better of people then to assume the worst of people.
- 
  

One of the best ways to test other people's temper is to test their patience over small things. If they get upset over the littlest things then that is gives you a clue into the way they will react over larger issues.
