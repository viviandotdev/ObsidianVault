## Integrate
- **When You Encounter Information You Like to Remember**
  - Mark them. For ideas you want to remember, create a shortcut to create an Anki card that is **marked** with a specific note type. This helps you remember to turn it into a more fine-grained note.
  - Every week or so, at your computer, look through your marked cards (highlights) in Anki and turn them into Q&A style questions. Delete the highlighted note, keeping only things that are interesting and you actually want to remember.
