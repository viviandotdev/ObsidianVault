> So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you&#39;d asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I&#39;d have said by spending all their money. That&#39;s how it happens in books and movies, because that&#39;s the colorful way to do it. But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments

> t&#39;s hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking &quot;wow, I&#39;m spending a lot of money.&quot; Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an eye

> spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn&#39;t. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you&#39;ve already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You&#39;re not spending the money; you&#39;re just moving it from one asset to another. Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say &quot;it&#39;s an investment.&quot;
