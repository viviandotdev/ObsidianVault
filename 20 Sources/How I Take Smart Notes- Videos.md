## How I Take Smart Notes- Videos

1. **Indexing:** Create a list of all the topics you will need to learn, **Layout a basic organizational structure of the content you will be watching or listening.**
	- For podcasts read the show notes, and time stamps
	- For videos/lecture, read the outline, ask AI to create bullet points
2. **What to write down and note**: Use the [Outline Method](https://www.toolshero.com/personal-development/outline-method-note-taking/). As you watch the video, fill in each main bullet point, nesting related concepts under each main node. 
	- Consume with a purpose, looking for answers to questions
	- Look for important **concepts**
	- Write down questions for gaps in understanding
		- Why and how questions
	-  Always think about how it relates to the big picture and make notes about how this concept can be applied.
	-  Avoid copying the speaker verbatim, **pause** the video and summarize the idea you found interesting concisely in your own words.

3. **Post Processing: **
	- Looking into other sources to fill in gaps in your understanding
	- Create permanent notes, taking the most atomic ideas and thoughts and rewording them into your own idea 
	- Create a mind map of the main concepts, grouping similar concepts together 
**Tips for reviewing and remembering what you learn**
    1. [[Active Recall]]: **On a blank sheet of paper**, recall everything you know about the topic / concept you are trying to learn. 
    2. **Spaced Repetition:** Create Anki cards on the information to need to remember to be recalled later
    3. Create Mind Maps to connect concepts/ideas and relate them to the big picture
    4. Create cards that explain the concept in the way you are teaching it to someone.
