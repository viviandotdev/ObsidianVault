## How to deal with setbacks

With our thoughts we create the world.
This is a **Buddha** concept where, anything that happens to you is not negative or positive but you have the power to choose how you want to frame the situation.
[[Our reality is influenced as much by our thoughts as it is by what actually happened.]]

If you are pessimistic and all you see is the negative side of everything.
For example something breaks or is not working the way you want want it to,
One way to think about this is to say why is this happening to me?
Another way is to think could this have happened at a worst time. Maybe this happening now is good because you can learn to fix it and decrease the likelihood of if happening in the future

Questions to help you see the positives of any situation?
1. Instant positives
2. Could it be worse?
3. Could the time be worse?
4. Does this open new opportunities?
5. Is there a lesson to learn from this?
