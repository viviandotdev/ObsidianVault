## Highlights
- It is a way for the writer to understand more clearly ideas and concepts. It is a way for the writer to participate in the world by sharing his feelings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfr2nn5q2hbscfn1898xpe1j))
- And once you’ve done this, especially if it has taken you considerable time and trouble, then it’s easy to assume that the process that helped you understand better will also help your readers understand well. And, very often, this is not true at all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfr2q74x2mse13k40r6hnfa5))
- The writing process can differ from the reading process not merely in minor aspects, but in profound ways.([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfr2qnm59x4x36aeph5h3a8t))
- academic texts succeed when the ‘something’ which is the topic of the text aligns with something that the readers want to understand well. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfr2vntped8dhgky4d6k7zsb))
- It is often the case that the text itself must show readers the inadequacy in their understanding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfr2watv22q7222gqsan8775))
- For our purposes, a Problem needs three components:
1. AN INSTABILITY:
2. THE CONSEQUENCES of that instability, presented
	- most often as the “Costs” of leaving the instability unstable;
	- sometimes as the “Benefits” of stabilizing it. 
3. READERS who constitute a community of discourse defined by their interest in a topic and who will accept or are open to accepting the cost/benefits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfr2yvgr2vppe4wzkmkqxsd0))

- **We claim that in order to perceive a problem, readers have to perceive that something is unstable: something doesn't fit; something is amiss**; something is wrong; something is incomplete; something is unknown; something is unresolved; something is contradicting something else; something causing tension; something is causing conflict; on and on and on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfr334pahxkrg04y9nve7z4b))
- In this elemental sense, the **problem is an instability and the text is valuable because it creates stability: something now fits, something is now right, something is complete, something is known; something is resolved; the tension is gone; the conflict is over; and on and on.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfr33cgyzqw4ahxzez00cpst))
- And it is crucial, as we'll see later on, that these costs and benefits be perceived as costs and benefits to the reader. One of the most common weaknesses of writing is that the writer describes costs and benefits borne by the writer, not the readers.
  Why should the reader care about your costs? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfr33vvv8070ns7k5ae5djxp))

- In such cases, you have still another writing task: you need to persuade readers that an instability exists where they do not already perceive one. You have to construct an instability. And the typical means of constructing an instability is to de- stabilize something the readers believe to be stable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfthyx19jd8sff057476wev4))
