Narrow specialists are people who know lots and lots about a specific subject but less and less about other things. These people are pendants.

Dilettante or a dabbler are amateurs in a wide range of areas.

I don't want to be either. Ted Gioia offers a 3rd solution:

**"I do immersive deep dives into new subjectsâ€”reading 40 or 50 books in a particular area. Then I move on to a different field of inquiry, and do the same thing all over again. This allows me to achieve a degree of specialization in many areas, without getting lost in any of the rabbit holes."**
