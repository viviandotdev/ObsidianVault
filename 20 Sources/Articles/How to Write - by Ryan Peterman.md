Writing Process
1. Outline - create a bulleted list to structure your thoughts, simple and malleable (20% of writing time)
	- Spend more time on the outline
	- Make sure your thinking in the outline is clear before creating the rough draft.
2. Rough Draft - turn your outline into prose (5% of writing time)
	- Get all the words down without thinking about quality.
3. Final Draft - polish your rough draft until satisfied. (75% of writing time)
	1. Read it over and over trying to reduce clutter and make it easier to read. **Focus on being understood by the reader and being interesting.**

**Big Document Method:**
1. **Big Document Creation:**
   - Begin by compiling every idea in my head into a single document, resulting in 50-100 pages of notes.
2. **Creating Mini Documents:**
   - Analyze the big document to group related ideas, forming 10 to 20 smaller, more focused documents.
3. **Ordering the Documents:**
   - Once categorized into smaller documents, arrange them in a logical sequence. This step forms the preliminary outline.
4. **Developing a Master Outline:**
   - With a clear sequence established, create a master outline. This entails making one comprehensive list of all topics, arranged in the correct order.
5. **Outlines within Outlines:**
   - Delve into each of the smaller documents to create detailed outlines for them. These detailed outlines serve as the blueprints for individual chapters.
6. **Initiating the Writing Process:**
   - Start writing without further delay. This phase is crucial as it helps in finding one's voice, refining the outline, and overcoming the intimidation of starting from scratch.
