**Big Document Method:**
1. **Big Document Creation:** Begin by compiling every idea in my head into a single document, resulting in 50-100 pages of notes.
2. **Creating Mini Documents:** Analyze the big document to group related ideas, forming 10 to 20 smaller, more focused documents.
3. **Ordering the Documents:** Once categorized into smaller documents, arrange them in a logical sequence.
4. **Developing a Master Outline:** With a clear sequence established, create a master outline.
5. **Outlines within Outlines:** Delve into each of the smaller documents to create detailed outlines for them.
6. **Initiating the Writing Process:** Start writing without further delay.
