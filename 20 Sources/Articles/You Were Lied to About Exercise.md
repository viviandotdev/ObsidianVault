## Highlights
- Since then, exercise has largely been reduced to mere calorie burning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqxx9n16vmfzg4p902ecjra))
- On the flip side, though, you can simply move more, or with more intensity—the more movement you get, the more calories you burn, thus increasing the deficit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqxxrpmzvah1bjy0rcxg2h7))
- This is what exercise has been reduced to, for a large portion of the population.
  But it **doesn’t really work that way.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqxy6b4dg9a8x3wb4a6rzz2))
- **At a certain point, energy expenditure plateaus: people with extremely active lives burn about the same as those with moderately active lives**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqxyfw13rbqwyxs9kp27g6d))
- Exercise isn’t just about calorie burn—it cannot be reduced to simple math, *because it’s so much more than that.*
  It’s about **cellular communication**. When we move our bodies, cells become more sensitive and responsive to insulin, allowing glucose (energy) to enter more easily. It reduces inflammatory signaling. And it enhances mitochondrial function, which, for some reason, the only thing we all collectively remember from high school biology is that the mitochondria (say it with me) *is the powerhouse of the cell.* Stronger mitochondria = more cellular energy with less waste, which = less fatigue, less brain fog, faster recovery, and slower aging.

- It’s about **hormone regulation**. Most people don’t know that muscle is an endocrine organ. When you move, contract, and build muscle, it releases signaling molecules—called myokines—that reduce inflammation, improve brain function, help regulate mood, metabolism, and immune response.
  It’s about **brain function**. Movement increases Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)—essentially Miracle Grow for neurons—which promotes neuroplasticity (making the brain more adaptable), increases neurogenesis (the growth of new neurons) to support memory and learning, regulates mood through modulating serotonin and dopamine, and shields neurons from oxidative stress. Without so many words, movement makes you a smarter, happier person, for longer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqxz7hgsy3rheraedna0dx4))
- They might be “weekend warriors”: runners, bikers, or hikers, and take cross-training seriously. They might do a “functional fitness” class like CrossFit. They’re in the gym doing sled pushes, dynamic, powerful movements, maybe some kettlebells. They consider themselves to have an “active lifestyle” and make the gym a priority.
  But there’s a problem: This subset of people is probably the most likely to hurt themselves. They’re still largely sedentary throughout most of their days, then overtraining, going too hard in the gym, not using proper periodization, or giving the body enough rest, leaving their bodies ill-equipped to handle the sudden high demand ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqy0mhsyf5cm9en2xa4jqtv))
- This is because, even when we’re “fit”, we’re still not giving the body the nutrient-dense movement that a resiliant and truly functional human body requires—*the movement it was designed for.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqy0v63kkb2qev2gq0tntk4))
- Sitting on the floor is one of the best ways to increase joint mobility of the lower limbs, and constantly getting up and down off the ground improves strength and balance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqy1n360pdmbznx4hbcxgbs))
- We’ve designed our world to exist between our hips and our shoulders. Rarely do we need to bend over, crawl, squat, reach, climb, or lift. In this world, movement has become a choice—a conscious, intentional, sometimes radical act. But the body will give you what you ask it—if you don’t ask for much, it won’t give you much.
