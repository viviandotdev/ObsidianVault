## The Labor Of Inspiration

Many creatives wait around for inspiration to show up to create. however the issue with this approach is how long will it take? One year, one month or one week.

Be a laborer, show up and do the thing for a set number of times. Map out exactly what you need to do. Your job is to simply show up and do it.
You need to create a regiment, to remove your reliance on external source.

**Laborer's create their own inspiration.**

**It is easier to go for a walk or read more books and watch videos about what you should be doing instead of actually doing.**

Siting down at the same time everyday and draw a lot. Create a set amount of drawings. Even if you have no idea what to draw set that time to think about what you want to draw.

At the beginning this process will seem boring but after a while the experience will become more enjoyable.

Instead of drawing something great all you need is to draw something. You want to lower the barrier to start so you can explore without any pressure. Follow the path of what you find interesting.


Throughout the day you want to balance the laborer and the fairy of inspiration. **Every time dedicate 1-2 hours being a laborer and the rest of the time can be for reading books and doing things to help you strike inspiration.**

For example, I am trying to learn to draw. however it is more fun to find resources and books about drawing that actually simply sitting down and drawing. I am constantly in the searching instead of putting in any action.
Same thing with learning about neural networks I am always on youtube and watching videos, but not actually digest and processing an of the information. I need to spend more time actually processing the information I consume instead of just letting everything in and doing nothing about it.
