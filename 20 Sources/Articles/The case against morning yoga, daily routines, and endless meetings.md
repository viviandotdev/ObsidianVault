**Find leverage. Create work assets that compound over time so that it spreads even when you sleep.** Maybe this is a project you've put out into the world, and customers can find it and share it. Or it's a series of videos or essays that grow in audience over time, and each new bit content builds upon the last.

But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:

1. **Become the best at one specific thing.**
2. **Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.**
Paul Graham said something similiar in his essay [[How to Do Great Work]]

The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don't recommend anyone even try.

**The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It's the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare.** And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.

**[[capitalism]] rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You make yourself rare by combining two or more "pretty goods" until no one else has your mix.**
