# Why The Smartest People I Know Set Constraints, Not Goals

Based on your notes, here is a clearer and more structured way to present the ideas about careers, goals, and constraints.

### The Power of Self-Imposed Constraints

The career paths of successful creatives underscore the power of self-imposed limits over fixed goals.

* **Feel like you're doing something:** Setting a goal can create a false sense of progress. For example, building a Notion dashboard for your goals feels like action, but it's often just a proxy for actual direction.

* **Goals vs. Constraints:**
    * **Goals are a winning condition.** They focus on the end result ("becoming a best-selling author").
    * **Constraints are the rules of the game.** They focus on the process and the present moment ("write every day, never write what bores me").
    * **Stop trying to "win" the game and start focusing on playing it well.**

### The "How" vs. "What's Possible"

* **Constraints force a different kind of thinking.** A fixed goal makes you think, "How do I get there?" A self-imposed constraint makes you think, "What is possible from here, given these rules?"
* This approach is inherently **adaptive** and allows for creativity to emerge within a defined structure.
* **Invisible constraints are what truly matter.** These are the rules you set for yourself that guide your daily actions, not the external targets you hope to hit.

### A Practical Example

* **Goal-Oriented Approach:**
    * **Goal:** Become a best-selling author.
    * This sets a distant, high-stakes target that can be demotivating and difficult to control.

* **Constraint-Oriented Approach:**
    * **Constraint:** Write every day, and never write what bores you.
    * This focuses on sustainable, creative actions within your control. Success becomes a byproduct of consistently following the rules you've set for yourself.
