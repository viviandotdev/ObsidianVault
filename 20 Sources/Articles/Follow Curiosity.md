**The motive should always be doing something for yourself. You should never worry about the money, status or prestige from creating it.**
 [[Build something just to prove to myself that I can, don't do it for the users, or money, do it because you can]]

Create it because you want learn. It does not matter if it sucks, or nobody uses it.
There is no pressure, to make it good.
Just finish, it does not have to be perfect, pretend no one is very going to look at the code but yourself.
The goal is to just get it working and you can polish it and clean it up after wards
I like to over think on what is the best way to do something and it is just a form of procrastination that just prevents from moving forward
