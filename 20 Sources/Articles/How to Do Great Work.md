**If you're not sure what to work on, guess**. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.

Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but **you'll be driving your part of it.**

**Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones.** This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.
- Choose a field -> building apps/software
- Notice gaps ->  mobile seems to be lagging behind web, I think the same way UI libraries are created for web will happen on mobile as well, I can start creating templates for mobile 

When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions. \[[5](https://paulgraham.com/#f5n)\]
- I want to read more biographies and memoirs of interesting people.
One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.

In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants

Lots of great things began with someone saying "How hard could it be?"

Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem.

Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you're surprised how far you've come.

**Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year.** That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.
- Try to get something done each day.
- It does not have to be something so difficult
- You show up to work everyday so why won’t you show up for yourself.
- It feels like there are no consequences but the consequence are that you don’t reach your full potential and that regret will only grow as time goes on so start now and give it your best shot.

**Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult.**
- Stop being so afraid of copying, you should be copying, copying the best work and copy from the people better than you. Originality is overrated and people will always be copying others.
- Don’t be original, copy someone else and just make it a little better. It does not even need to be better it can just be for your preference.
- It don’t matter if not one uses it as long as you use and it makes your own life better then it was all worth it.

Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas.

Don't divide your attention *evenly* between many topics though, or you'll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it according to something more like a power law
- Divide up your time like an exponential curve
- 16 hours a day
- 4 hours working
- 4 hours programming/personal projects
- 2 hours drawing
- 2 hours  writing
- 2 hours climbing + commute
- 1 hour eating/chores
- Programming is my main thing -> then writing then drawing
- Climbing is something that is part of me, it is like eating and sleeping I must do it 
- Exercise should not be optional


if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules.

if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what you're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.

Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its latent potential.

**It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're making something for people — to get an initial version in front of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.**
- Create something that is just a copy first, then iterate on it more and it will become more and more your own. But first you need to make the copy

An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a toy. It's a good sign when people do this.

**If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.**
- Go into your projects with little planning bias towards action and making the thing and figure it out along the way

**Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working on it,** you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and encountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying to do something slightly too hard.
- [[It's about being, not having  Derek Sivers]]
- It’s about the process, the process should be enjoyable for you or else it is not worth it.
- The reward should be working on it.
- Founders podcast, he enjoy reading and podcasting, it is all he has wanted to do. He spends very little time on vocation and is always working on his podcast because that’s what he wants to do.
- [[Focus on making each day great, as a great life is a string of great days.]]

he advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the former when old.

The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly frivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.

Spend time lavishly when you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing something you know for sure will be.


So stop looking for that kind of shortcut.

**People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing inherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how something works than by trying to reproduce it.**
- the best way to learn how something works it to reproduce it.
- This means copying the great works of people before you
- Understand the decisions they made and copy it

**Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.**

**New discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of existing things**, *even by their discoverers*, because there isn't yet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.
- [[New discoveries are usually just variations of existing things.]]

One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another.

One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting.


**If at first you don't succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again.**
	What does back tracking looking like though?

A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.

Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work, or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition; so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you, or does and doesn't care.


Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.

Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with [[curiosity]].

So the problem boils down to ability and interest. **Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?**
- Where interest and ability combine is where you will find people doing great dowry

**Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a combination of modesty and fear**
- [[Don’t let modesty and fear hold you back from building the things you want]]


But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy away from the question.

**Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done by procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by procrastinating for several years.**
	- Every minute you are not doing the work you want to do you are procrastinating. Procrastinating for a day may seem like nothing but it can easily turn into years. I have already procrastinated for 3 years. I think I have wasted enough time and it is time to start building something again.

Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work, or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition; so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you, or does and doesn't care.
