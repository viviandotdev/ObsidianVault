&gt;You&#39;ll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s
&gt;good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries
&gt;come from noticing connections between different fields.

&gt;biographies of people who&#39;ve done great work, it&#39;s remarkable how
&gt;much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result
&gt;of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.
&gt;So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to
&gt;do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people,
&gt;read lots of books, ask lots of questions.
