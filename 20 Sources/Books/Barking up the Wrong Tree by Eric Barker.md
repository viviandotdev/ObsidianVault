# Barking Up the Wrong Tree
by [[Eric Barker]]

### Trust Cooperation and Kindness
[[Those who consistently help others are overrepresented at both the top and bottom of success metrics.]]
[[Trust and Cooperation]]

### Games
- [[WNGF (Whiny neutered goats fly) What makes a good game]]
- [[Meaningful work is something it important to you and something that you are good at]]

### Relationships
- [[Early on, "love marriages" are happier than "arranged marriages". However, overtime studies shows that arranged marriages have a lower divorce rates and more content couples.]]
- [[Making friends]]
- [[Responding to conflicts in relationships]]
Express your gratitude toward others. Feeling gratitude and not expression it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.
### Goals
- [[If you want to follow through with your goals, phrase them in this simple way (If…then...)]]
[[Power reduces empathy and causes us to be more selfish]]
- [[Confidence is the result of success, not the cause. The surest path to confidence is becoming excellent at what you do.]]
- [[After the 120 mark, IQ has little effect in what we are capable of]]
### Choices
- [[Sacrificing vs Maximizing]]
-  [[We don’t do what actually makes us happy we choose to do what is easy.]]
-  [[It is easier to decrease to reduce the effort (ability) to do something than to increase motivation]]

### What makes a successful life?
- [[Success is not the result of any single quality, it’s about the alignment between who you are and where you choose to be.]]
- [[Success cultivates more success.]]
-  [[Balance the big four metrics of success to create a well rounded life with no regrets.]]


### Framework to getting started
- **Track your time for a week**: physically write down where each hour goes towards for a week.
	- you will see that you are wasting more time then you think
- Note which hours are spent on the main big four (Happiness, Achievement, Significance and Legacy)
- Look for the hot spots in your day when you waste the more time and try to balance them
- Think about how many hours you want to spend on each of the big four

### TO-DO LISTS ARE EVIL. SCHEDULE EVERYTHING.
- Schedule work blocks related to the big four into your calendar
- Slot in the work based on priority
- Schedule in real deep work

**ENVIRONMENT:**
- Create an environment that helps you work, get deep work. Dedicate at least 2 hours a day for personal deep work
