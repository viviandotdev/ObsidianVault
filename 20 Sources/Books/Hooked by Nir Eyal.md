### Hooked
by Nir Eyal, Ryan Hoover

## The Book in 3 Sentences
This book is about how to create products that users keep coming back to. Products that follow the Hook Model are very likely to succeed. The hook model contains four stages, **Trigger**, **Action**, **Variable Reward and Investment

## Top Quotes
- **Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily routines.**
- **Make your product so simple that users already know how to use it, and you’ve got a winner.**
- **A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of pain.**
- **Influencing behavior by reducing the effort required to perform an action is more effective than increasing someone’s desire to do it.

### Hook Model
An experience designed to connect the user problem to a solution frequently enough to form a habit. To determine success of a product was to look at the product's habit-forming potential by plotting two factors, **frequency**  (how often the behavior occurs) and **perceived utility**  (how useful and rewarding the behavior is in the user’s mind over alternative solutions)

### The Hook Model Contains 4 Phases:
1. **Trigger**: 2 Types of Triggers
	**External**: is information that tells the user what to do next.
		- Paid Triggers: advertising
		- Earned triggers: a featured app on the app store
		- Relationship trigger: a person telling you about the product
		- Owned Trigger: having the app icon on homescreen
	**Internal**: manifests in your own mind, usually caused by emotions
		- Negative emotions such as **boredom**, feelings of **loneliness** are powerful internal triggers.
	To find what are the internal triggers of your product, create a user narrative and continuously ask why?
2. **Action**: behavior done in anticipation of reward
	[[Fogg Behavior Model]]: **B = MAT**
		A given behavior will occur when motivation, ability and trigger are present at the same time and in sufficient degrees
**We can influence the behavior of our users, by reducing the effort required to do it instead of increasing their desire to do it.**
**“Elements of simplicity”—the factors that influence a task’s difficulty**
		- **Time**—how long it takes to complete an action
		- **Money**—the fiscal cost of taking an action.
		- **Physical** effort—the amount of labor involved in taking the action.
		- **Brain** cycles—the level of mental effort and focus required to take an action. (too confusing?)
		- **Social** deviance—how accepted the behavior is by others. (outside the norm)
		- **Non**-routine- How much the action matches or disrupts existing routines. (too new or different)
By reducing each of the elements of simplicity we can influence users behavior.
**The good product should be so simple that users already know how to use it.**
We can use *heuristics*, which are cognitive shortcuts we use to make decisions, to make users do things
**[[The Scarcity Effect]]**
Cognitive bias that makes people place more value in objects that are scarce.
Companies use this effect, to make people purchase their products.
**[[The Framing Effect]]**
Our mind takes shortcuts informed by our surrounds to make quick judgments. For example when participate of a study were told that the cost of the wine they were trying was more expensive they experienced more enjoyment. **The brain also showed higher spikes in the pleasure areas **

3. **Variable Reward**
Three Types of Variable Rewards: Habit forming products use one or more of the these types. Email uses all three types.

**Rewards of The Tribe**
All humans are motivated to seek social acceptance and avoid rejection. These are social rewards we get from feeling connected and accepted by other people.
Logging into Facebook, you see an endless stream of various content from friends and a tally of how many people have liked your content.
The uncertainty of what users will find each time they visit the site creates the intrigue needed to pull them back again.

**Rewards of The Hunt**
Humans have the need to acquire things.
Slot machines award money in **random** intervals to keep users coming back with the change of hitting a jackpot
Similarly endless **feed** of information keeps

**Rewards of The Self**
Reward we receive from overcoming personal obstacles. For example, when users achieve "inbox zero" they feel a sense of achievement.
These few words, placed at the end of a request, are a highly effective way to gain compliance, doubling the likelihood of people saying yes.
The “but you are free” technique demonstrates how we are more likely to be persuaded to give when our ability to choose is reaffirmed
The product should make sure the users feel that have the control

**[[Variable rewards are one of the key was keeping users hooked. ]]Sites with infinite variability, YouTube, Facebook there is an infinite stream of unpredictable new information and content at all times.**

4. **Investment**
The final stage is the investment, this phase is important because it increases the odds that users will come back to the product.
**During this phase users puts something into the product such as time, data, money or effort.**
	The more effort we put into something the more value it, the Ikea effect is a cognitive bias where. consumers place more value on things they have built or created.
**Examples**
- TikTok the user take a lot of **effort** into curating their for you page, therefore that values that. It also sets a **future trigger,** it provides the company with more data they can use to tailor the for your page to keep the use engaged with the content.
- Snapchat, through the app users have **collected** memories and experiences which become valuable overtime, this make is difficult for users to leave the platform

### Pinterest as an Example of the Hook Model
1. **Trigger**: Internal trigger, the user feel boredom and opens the app to relieve their boredom. Ex
2. **Action**: The app is simple to use, all the user has to do is scroll.
3. **Variable Rewards**: As the user scrolls, they will receive variable rewards as they **hunt** for objects they desire.  They also receive tribal rewards, the sites have the ability to communicate with friends with similar interests,
4. **Investments**: Users invest into the site every time they pin an image, like an image or comment on someone's image. Each of these investments provide Pinterest will further data that they can use to tailor their feed. In addition, when users add images to the site it gives Pinterest permission to send a user notifications when someone pins their image creating an external trigger
