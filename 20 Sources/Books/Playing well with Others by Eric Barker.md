Beautiful Mess Effect: we always overestimate how negatively our errors will be perceived. However most people actually see your mistakes as a positive. When you see others make errors you are rarely judgmental and it often brings you closer to that person.

### Relationships
[[Love is actually misdiagnosed as major depressive episodes by mental health professionals]]

[[The irrationality of love is exceedingly rational.]]

### Love and entropy, regression of love:
Most romantic love drops off after a year to a year and a half. The addicts have become habituated to the drug and the high wears off. This makes sense since we can’t be lovestruck maniacs forever.

After first 4 years of marriage satisfactions drops an average of 15 - 20 %.
Love like most things in the physical universe is subject to entropy and will die down eventually. This is the number of threat to relationships “fading away enthusiasm”


The mortal enemy of love is reality.
Studies have shown [[idealistic distortion]] halved when couples went from engaged to married.
As the  [[idealistic distortion]] fades, the traits that we initially viewed as positive shifts to negatives:
	- laid back becomes lazy
	- Strong becomes stubborn
	- Caring becomes clingy

[[Negative Sentiment Override]]

Treat your partner like a child, we create problems because always expect our partner to be a competent emotionally stable “adult” we were are not. We are less likely to think a children is motivated by conscious malice, we think they must be tired, hungry or don’t know any better.

People who are more compassionate towards their partner during arguments have stronger marriages and shorter and less arguments.

### Being Alone

Solitude played a critical part in the spiritual paths of Jesus, Buddha, and Muhammad. Nobody thinks you find deep spiritual insight at a house party
We need alone time to recharge and reflect. And we rightfully associate solitude with creative breakthroughs. Isaac Newton discovered the law of gravity when he was isolated in Woolsthorpe during 1665, Ludwig von Beethoven, Franz Kafka, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and countless others did their best work while alone and wouldn’t have it any other way.
And a 2003 study by Cacioppo showed, on average, lonely people actually spend as much time with others as nonlonely people do.

## Loneliness and the Modern world
The social contract gave way to autonomy, and we went from communal to competitive.

Numerous cross-cultural studies have shown that modern society—despite its nearly miraculous advances in medicine, science, and technology—is afflicted with some of the highest rates of depression, schizophrenia, poor health, anxiety, and chronic loneliness in human history

Inviting friends over dropped by 35 percent. Putnam writes, “Virtually all forms of family togetherness became less common over the last quarter of the twentieth cent ury.” And the primary culprit he identified? **Television**
But where are many finding their tribes these days Video games. Which ones are preferred by people suffering from internet addiction? Psychotherapist Hilarie Cash told Johann Hari: “The highly popular games are the multiplayer games, where you get to be part of a guild—which is a team—and you get to earn your status in that guild . . . It’s tribalism at its core.”


### Popularity and success

> Celebrities have nearly twice the rate of alcohol problems that the average person does and more than a quadrupling of the suicide rate.


Be likable Popular not Status Popular

> A focus on intrinsic goals. Likable people may not have the same sway that high-status folks do, but they’re the ones we trust and feel warm around. They’re cooperative and kind. And this type of popularity does lead to happiness.


### Narcistics

Our desire for individualistic control gave us a lot of power, like status does. But it also bred disconnection and isn’t as fulfilling as being likable and having a community of people who love you.
 
Today’s young people want to be famous more than anything else.
In our individualistic culture today, status is on its way to becoming synonymous with self-worth, and as Prinstein points out, this isn’t a great recipe for happiness. It is, however, a great recipe for narcissism.
A 2010 study of over fourteen thousand college students noted a 40 percent decline in empathy over the past few decades, while a separate study (“Egos Inflating over Time”) found **scores on the Narcissism Personality Index increased by almost 50 percent between 1990 and 2006 among a similar cohort. In the twenty-first century, narcissism has been increasing as quickly as obesity**


### Cooperation

The biggest explanation for their effects is that they simulate care. **Care we’re lacking in the modern world**

Because we were the smartest? We weren’t. **Neanderthals were. Your brain is 15 percent smaller than theirs.** Recent discoveries show they had fire and music and culture and cave paintings

Our ability to collaborate, to help, even when things were at their worst, meant, over time, we won and they lost. Despite their bigger brains, [[Neanderthals could work together only in tribes of ten to fifteen, but our collaborative superpowers allowed us to scale to bands of over a hundred]]

### Communities
**Feeling loved by five separate pals is less loving than five mutual pals. Friends are great. Communities can be even better.**
There, the definition of happiness is more collectivist. To be happier, you’ll try to help others and your efforts will be more successful. As Ford told Hari, “The more you think happiness is a social thing, the better off you are.” You can get happier. But to rise, you must first think of how to lift others
The lack of community makes our gray matter feel unsafe, pushing us toward a greater need for control in our lives and relationships

### Belonging
To Belong Is to Matter: Sense of Belonging Enhances Meaning in Life,” didn’t just find a correlation. Belonging caused a feeling of meaning in life
Belonging. It’s why our species’ superpower is cooperation. It’s what we saw with drug addiction hijacking the social reward pathways of the human brain. It’s what we saw with the placebo effect curing ills by telling your body someone cares
