## Never Split the Difference
By; Chris Voss


**What is the goal of a Negotiation?**
A negotiation is a process of discovery, not a battle of arguments. Uncover as much information as possible.
Persuasion is about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want it their own idea. Listen and ask them questions that opens paths to your goals.
Persuade then that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.

[[Active Listening]]: is focusing on the what the other person is saying, listen more to how their voice changes than their body language.

### Negotiation Tactics
**Mirroring:**  [[Mirroring facilitates bonding, and encourages the other side to empathize with you.]]

**We can use mirroring to confront without confrontation?**

> It’s just four simple steps:
> 1.Use the late-night FM DJ voice.
> 2.Start with “I’m sorry . . .”
> 3.Mirror.
> 4.Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart.
> 5.Repeat.


**Labeling**: Labeling validates someone's emotions by acknowledging it. It gets you close to someone by showing that you identify with how that person feels.
Spot your opponents feelings, turn them into words, and calmly repeat their emotions back to them. Labelling almost always begins like this:
> It seems like . . .
> It sounds like . . .
> It looks like . . .

Notice that it does not start with "I", saying "I" gets people's guards up and makes them think that you are more interested in yourself than the other person.

After you say a label, be quiet and listen. This silence invites the other person to reveal themselves. Don't worry your opponent will find a way to fill this silence.

**Yes vs No**
When we negotiate, we want to finish with a "Yes". However, gunning for the "**Yes**" immediately can get your counterpart to feel **defensive and wary.** Throughout a negotiation, you need to be comfortable hearing No  is not the end of a negotiation but a start of one.

**The Three Types of Yes**
- **Counterfeit**: your counterpart wants to say "no" but feels the need to say "yes" to escape this situation.
- **Confirmation**: is a simple affirmation with no promise on action
- **Commitment**: this is the yes you want, it is true agreement that leads to action.

**No is Protection and Safety**
- Allows real issues to be brought forth
- **Protects** people from making and correct ineffective decisions.
- Slows things down, so people can freely embrace their decisions and agreements
- helps people **feel safe, secure**, emotional comfortable and in **control** of their decisions.
- Moves things forward


**How to get them to say no?**
Ask them no oriented questions. If you want your opponent to open up more to you and feel safe and control, you can force them into a "No" by:
- Intentionally mislabeling one of their emotions, or desires.
	- It seems like you want this project to fail?

**Why do No oriented questions work?**
The No answer demands offers the opponent a feeling of safety and control and **encourages them to define and explain their position to you.**

**Examples of No Oriented Questions:**
- Do you want the FBI to be embarrassed?
- Have you given up on this project?
- Is now a. bad time to talk? Is better than do you have a few minutes to talk?


**Behavior Change Stairway Model**
1. Active Listening
2. empathy
3. Rapport
4. Influence
5. Behavior Change

**That's Right is better than Yes**
This signals that negotiations could proceed from deadlock. It breaks down the barriers that were preventing progress. That's right, triggers behavior change.

"That's right". Signals that you've convinced someone that you truly **understand their feelings,** mental and behavior change is possible.
The more a person feel understood, the more likely for constructive behavior change.

**How to trigger a that's right.**
Use a **summary** to trigger a "that's right". The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing.  The only possible response for a good summary would be that's right.
Clearly articulate to them what they want.


**Never Compromise**
- We compromise because we it's easy, and it saves face and is safe. During a negotiation most people are driven by fear and the desire to avoid pain which is not your goal

**Deadline**
When negotiators tell their opponent about their deadlines, they get better deals.
	Deadline reduce the risk of a deadlock
	With deadlines your opponent will get straight to the point and make decisions more quickly.

**All Decisions are Emotional**
We use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision , but the actual decision-making is emotional. When studying people who had the part of their brain where emotions are generated damaged, they couldn't make the simplest decisions. Even though they could describe exactly what they should do logically, they still couldn't make a choice.


### Ways the word fair is used
1. **"We just want whats fair"**
 This implicit accusation of unfairness to you triggers feelings of defensiveness and discomfort. **These feelings are often subconcious and lead to irrational concession.**
 When you use this against another party they might get rattled and suddenly increase the offer. If this happens the best response is to say "**Okay, I apologize, Let's stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfarily and we'll fix it."**

2. **"We’ve given you a fair offer. ”**
This phrase is basically accusing you of being dense or dishonest
It’s a terrible little jab meant to distract your attention and manipulate you into giving in.

If you mind your self in this situation, mirror the "F" thrown at you. **Respond with "Fair", then pause** and let your opponent feel the power of word to do to them as it was intended to do to you. Then **follow the pause with the label: "It seems like you're ready to provide the evidence that support that".** This alludes to them handing over information to either contradict their claim of fairness or give you more data to work with.

3. - **How to use the word fair in positive and constructive way.**
- Early in a negotiation say: **"I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I'm being unfair, and we'll address it"**
- This simple phrase lets people know that it is okay to use this word if they use it honestly


### Salary Negotiations
1. **Anchor their emotions in preparations for a loss if a deal is not made**, you bring out their. [[Loss Aversion]], so they will try to do anything to avoid it.
	- Bend their reality, before making an offer, **emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be.** Set extreme anchors to make your "real" offer seem reasonable.
	 - Say: "I got a lousy proposition for you, By the time we get of this phone  you're going to think  am a lousy businessman, but **I still wanted to bring you this opportunity before I took it to someone else** I can give you $500 a day".
	- By phrasing it like this, the call was now about how to not lose $500 to some other guy instead of being cut from $2000 to 500 dollars.
**How people between options that involve risk?**
	- **Certainty Effect:** People are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice.
	- **[[Loss Aversion]]:** People will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains.
2. **Let the other side go first to** anchor monetary negotiations.
	- Be prepared to withstand the first offer, they may go for an extreme anchor to bend your reality.
3. If you must go first, **allude to a range**. This makes it seem like you are making an offer and can bend their reality in the process
	- Say something like: **"at top places like X Corp, people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000"** by saying this the firm would probably offer **$130,000** because it looks so cheap next to **170,000**
	- people who hear extreme anchors unconsciously adjust their expectations in the direction of the opening number.
	- Studies show applications who name a range received higher overall salaries than those who offered a number.
	- If you offer a range, expect them to come in at the low end.
	- "Bolstering range": is a range where the low number in the range is what they actually wanted.
4. **Talk about non-monetary terms**
	- After anchoring high, you can make the offer seem reasonable by offering things that aren't important to you but important to them
	- Or if their offer is low, you can ask for things that are valuable to you but cheap for them
	- be pleasant and talk about non-salary terms, the more likely, you are hear the full range of their options.
1. Use odd numbers
	- number that end in 0 feel like guesstimates that can be easily negotiates off of.
	- Less rounded figures such as $37,263 seems like a result of a thoughtful calculation
2.  Surprise with a gift
	- after staking an extreme anchor, after the inevitable first rejection, offer them an unrelated gift.
	- When someone gives you an offer that you don't want to accept, this bends their reality, and they be questions themselves and think maybe their offer is unreasonable.
		- Ask "How am I supposed to do that?"
		- "How am I supposed to come up with that kind of money"
		- Either they respond with more information or they will lower their price

### After negotiating a salary
1. After negotiating a salary, define the success for your position.
2. Interview Question: **“What does it take to be successful here/in this position?”**
	The interviewer will often give a very detailed answer. When someone gives you guidance, they will watch to see if you follow their advice. They will have a personal stake in your success, and you gain an unofficial mentor.


### Calibrated Questions (asking for help)
[[Calibrated Questions]]

"How" questions force the other side to think about how to solve the problem. "How" engages the other side because it asks for help. It gives them the illusion of control but really you are the one framing the conversation.

### Why calibrated questions work
Negotiations start with "unbelief": active resistance to what the other side is saying.
If you don't get off this dynamic, you end having shutdowns as each side tries to impose their beliefs on to another.
**Calibrated questions** helps the other side, drop their unbelief so you can slowly work them towards your point of view.
To persuade them you just need to get them to stop unbelieving.

Calibrated questions help you disagree without being disagreeable.

**The best calibrated questions begin with how: "How am I supposed to do that?"**
When asking these questions your delivery must really convey that you are asking for help.
For example if negotiating prices, instead of bullying the clerk into bringing the price down, say the price is a little higher than you budgeted for and then ask "How am I supposed to do that". By genuinely asking them for advice you give them the illusion of control.

A powerful technique is to
summarize the situation and then ask How am I supposed to do that?

Use softening words and phrases: "perhaps", "maybe", "I think" and "it seems" and calibrated questions takes the aggression out of a confrontational statement.

[[How to create calibrated questions]]

### The How questions
3. “**How**” question when, correctly used, are gentle and graceful ways to say “No” and guide your counterpart to develop a better solution—your solution.
4. How questions keep negotiations going, and can buy you more time.
5. How questions force your counterpart to explain how the deal will be implemented.
	- as they articulate the implementation in their own words through your "how" questions you will convince them that the solution was their idea.
### When should you use calibrated questions?
- use them early and often.
- what is the biggest challenge you face? is one you can use in the beginning of nearly every negotiation.
	- this gives the opponent an opportunity to teach you something about themselves'
- when you are attacked in a negotiation pause and avoid angry emotional reactions, instead ask them a calibrated question.

**How to get people to see things your way**
1. do not confront them on their ideas.
	- You can't leave
2. acknowledge their ideas openly
	- I understand why you're pissed off
3. guide them toward solving the problem
	- what do you hope to accomplish by leaving?


### Negotiation script
1. A "No" oriented email question to reinitiate contact.
2. A statement that leaves only an answer of "that's right" to form a dynamic agreement
3. Calibrated questions about the problem to get him to reveal his thinking.
4. More "no" oriented questions to remove unspoken barriers.
5. Labelling and mirroring his answers if they are not acceptable so he can rethink them.
6. A calibrated question in reply to any offer other than full payment in order to get him to offer a solution: "How am I supposed to do that?"
7. if you still do not get what you want, state a label that flatters his sense of control and power.
8. Take a long pause and then one more "no" oriented question.


**Example of the above script in negotiating a bill**

### Execution
**Rule of three**
The Rule of Three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation. It’s tripling the strength of whatever dynamic you’re trying to drill into at the moment. In doing so, it uncovers problems before they happen. It’s really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction.
The first time they agree to something or give you a commitment, that’s No. 1.
For No. 2 you might label or summarize what they said so they answer, “That’s right.”
No. 3 could be a calibrated “How” or “What” question about implementation that asks them to explain what will constitute success, something like “What do we do if we get off track?”
Or the three times might just be the same calibrated question phrased three different ways, like “What’s the biggest challenge you faced? What are we up against here? What do you see as being the most difficult thing to get around?”
### How to interpret your counterpart non-verbal cues to detect lies

## Detecting Lies

And we’re terrible at detecting lies, averaging a 54 percent success rate.

Ask lots of open-ended questions that start with **“What” or “How,”** not things that can be answered with one word. You want to be friendly and say just enough to keep ’em gabbing. Letting them monologue makes them feel in control.
If you immediately start challenging what they say, not only might they shut down

Start off with expected questions. This is un-intimidating and gets you info—but more important, it gets you a baseline.
And lead them to say something that contradicts the info you dug up. Ask for clarification so they commit to it. And then: Sorry, I’m confused.

**Pinchchio Effect**
Liars use more words and spoke with more complex sentences than truth tellers. They also use more third-person pronouns such as him, her, it one, they rather than I to put distance between them and the lie.

### Getting the Counterpart to bid against themselves using the Multi-step no
Say "No" using "How" questions. You can usually **express "No" four times before saying the actual word**. These responses won't shutdown the other side but will sound like counter bids so that you counterpart will often keep bidding against themselves

1. Standby "No": How am i supposed to do that?
	- deliver this is a deferential way so i sounds like a request for help. This invites the other side to help you with a better offer
1. After they give you an offer say: "You offer is very generous. I'm sorry that just doesn't work for me".
	- avoids making a counter offer and the use of "generous" nutures your counterpart to live up to the word. "I'm sorry" softens the no and build empathy.

1. Listen to their response and say "I'm sorry but I'm afraid I just can't do that".
	- this is more direct, by expressing inability to perform it triggered the other side's empathy toward you.

**Example of Multi Step No:**
- First “No” message: The price you offered is very fair, and I certainly wish that I could afford it. Bruno has worked very hard for this business, and he deserves to be compensated appropriately. I am very sorry, but wish you the best of luck.

- Second gentle “No”: Thank you for your offer. You were generous to reduce the price, which I greatly appreciate. I really wish that I could pay you this amount, but I am sincere in that I cannot afford this amount at this time. As you know, I am in the middle of a divorce and I just cannot come up with that type of money. Again, I wish you the best of luck.

- Final No: Thank you again for the generous offer. You have really come down on the price and I have tried very hard to come up with that amount. Unfortunately, no one is willing to lend me the money, not even my mother. I have tried various avenues but cannot come up with the funding. In the end, I can offer you €23,567, although I can only pay €15,321.37 up front. I could pay you the remainder over a one-year period, but that is really the most I can do. I wish you the best in your decision
### Types of negotiators
****ANALYST**

i think there was a mistkae since i intially signed on to the tecdp program as remote but when the return to office began i was placed in the new jersy office for some reason even though i currently live in new york, i have contated jeff about this and he is working on getting me a desk in the new york office so in the mean time i a still workking from hom. howver i did also want to talk about if there is anyone i can talk to about a salary increase due to location, i currently queens and can live at home with my parents since i work from home  however since the communte to the new york office is an hour to hour and half commute for me i have looking from appretings within mnahattan that is closer to the cigna office to help with the lengthly commute howver it seems that my currently salary dones not align with the cost of living in new york city, how am i supposed to affort rent and basic needs in new york city with a salary of 81,000?

### How to negotiate rent using Ackerman Plan
1. Do research on building the neighborhood offering lower prices and say:
	Even though your building is better is terms of location is services, **How am i supposed to pay $200 extra?**
2. the agent says: you make a good point but this is still a good price.
3. the response by stating an anchor:
	I fully understand you do have a better location and amenities but I'm sorry i just can't, would 1,730 for a year lease sound fair to you?
4. the agent laughs and says there is no way he can accept this number.
5. respond with a calibrated question:
	okay so help me understand: **how do you price lease renewals?**
6. the agent explains the factors and then says one month unrented would be $2000 loss. Now you have leverage because if this deal does not go through the agent will clearly have something to lose. you can use this information.
7. make another offer: how about $1790?
8. agent responds: the offer is still to low, I ran the the numbers and I willing to offer you $1950
9. next say with without saying "No"
	This is generous of you, but h**ow am I supposed to accept it when I can move a few blocks away and stay for $1800?.** (calibrated question) $150 dollars means a lot to me. You know I am a student. I don't know, **it seems like you would rather run the risk of keeping the place unrented.**  (label)
10. the agent says "it not that, but i can't give you a number lower than the market"
11. Pause and then say "Then I tell you want, I initially went from 1730 to 1790, but i will bring it up to 1810, and i think this works well for both of us"
12. the agent shakes his head and says this is still lower than the market.
13. then use last **Ackerman offer**, pretend to some fake calculations and say "I did some numbers and the maximum i can afford is 1829"
14. the agent says okay I can make this work.


### Ackerman Plan

Start with an anchor, the anchoring effect is a bias that can trick you into putting a number in your head, which can distort your perception, here we will talk about it for prices. For example :
« I have a friend who does the same job for $ 3,000 »,
« I visited a similar property for $ 185,000 »,
« I don’t think I can offer you more than $ 65 ».

Prepare an Ackerman plan. Before you head into the weeds of bargaining, you’ll need a plan of extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100 percent. Decreasing raises and ending on nonround numbers will get your counterpart to believe that he’s squeezing you for all you’re worth when you’re really getting to the number you want.

- Negotiating a salary. Your target : $ 50,000. Start by announcing 76,500 (135%), then 57,500 (115%), then 52,500 and your last offer at 50,417 (100%).
- Negotiation of a piece of furniture sold for $ 250 , your target is $200. Begin $ 130 (65%), then 170 (85%), then 190 (95%) and finally $ 198 (100%).

### Black Swans
**Black Swans are important pieces of information that can give you leverage in a negotiation**


**What is Leverage is why is important in a negotiation**

To gain leverage you have to persuade your counterpart that they have something real to lose if the deal falls through.

### Types of leverage
**Positive**
Ability to provide or withhold things that the counterpart wants. When the counterpart says "I want to buy your car", you have the positive leverage because you can make their desire come true.
**Negative**
**Based on threats, and it is your ability to make your counterpart suffer.** "You will destroy them if they don't take this offer." You have the ability to take something from them if this deal does not go through. This kind of leverage uses loss aversion, where potential losses feel larger to people than similar gains.
To gain this leverage look for what is important to your counterpart.
- what worries them
- what signifies status and reputation to them
**Don't use threats instead label the negative leverage with sentences like**
- it seems like you don't care what position you are leaving me in.
**Normative**
Using your opponent's norms and standards to. advance your position. Show the inconsistencies between their beliefs and actions. No one wants to look like a hypocrite. Ask what they believe and listen. You gain normative leverage when you can **make them believe they losing something because they are acting not inline with their moral framework or set of rules by not taking this offer.**



**How to reveal black swans**
1. face to face time
2. observe unguarded moments
	- meetings are guarded, brief relaxations before and after meetings are the best times to get black swans
3. use labeling and calibrated questions to get your opponent to reveal their black swans


**Gain trust using similarity and reason, you want to make them feel like you understand them**

**Using similarity**
We trust. people we are similar to. Find similarities in beliefs, ideas and even modes of trust so we can get then to like and trust you more. Even shallow similarities such as college alumni status increase rapport.

**Using reason**
People respond favorably to requests made in a reasonable tone of voice and followed with a “because” reason.
Without her giving a reason, 60 percent let her through, but when she did give one, more than 90 percent did.
And it didn’t matter if the reason made sense.
People just responded positively to the framework.


**They are not being irrational, it is a clue that there is information that you are missing**
1. they are ill-informed, they are operating on incomplete information or different information than you which is why their actions may seem irrational to you. You need to **discover that they don't know** and why they are acting this way.
2.  if your counterpart is acting shaky, there is possibility that they have **things that they can't do but don't want to reveal**. They are simply complying to needs and desires that you don't understand. your job is to figure out these needs and desires.
