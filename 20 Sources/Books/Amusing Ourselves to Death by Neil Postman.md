# Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business
by Neil Postman

## **Summary**

The book argues that it is the Huxley warnings not Orwell’s were right. We are controlled by inflicting pleasure. Every dopamine hit we get from a like is controlling us to use the app more. Every time we refresh our timeline we are being controlled. The advertisements shown on the sites we visit control our decisions. We no longer have control over our attention.

## **Favorite Quotes**

- [In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are **controlled by inflicting pleasure**](https://www.notion.so/baa7111e781246d694379a4f57393f85?pvs=21)
- media-metaphors classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, color it, argue a case for what the world is like
- **the clock made us into time-keepers, and then time-savers, and now time-servers.**
- It is no accident that the Age of Reason was coexistent with the growth of a print culture, first in Europe and then in America
- The news elicits from you a variety of opinions about which you can do nothing except to offer them as more news, about which you can do nothing.

## **Detailed Notes**

**FOREWORD**

- [In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are **controlled by inflicting pleasure**.](https://www.notion.so/baa7111e781246d694379a4f57393f85?pvs=21) In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.
- Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

**THE MEDIUM IS THE METAPHOR**

- It’s great to be an entertainer. Indeed, in America God favors all those who possess both a talent and a format to amuse, whether they be preachers, athletes, entrepreneurs, politicians, teachers or journalists. In America, the least amusing people are its professional entertainers.
- Whether we are experiencing the world through the lens of speech or the printed word or the television camera, our **media-metaphors classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, color it, argue a case for what the world is like**
- A person who reads a book or who watches television or who glances at his watch is not usually interested in how his mind is organized and controlled by these events, still less in what idea of the world is suggested by a book, television, or a watch
- In Mumford’s great book Technics and Civilization, he shows how, beginning in the fourteenth century, **the clock made us into time-keepers, and then time-savers, and now time-servers.**

**MEDIA AS EPISTEMOLOGY**

- **Epistemology**-the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion.
- **Epistemology** is a complex and usually opaque subject concerned with the origins and nature of knowledge.
- Every medium of communication, I am claiming, has resonance, for resonance is metaphor writ large. Whatever the original and limited context of its use may have been, a medium has the power to fly far beyond that context into new and unexpected ones
- And it is always implicated in the ways we define and regulate our ideas of truth.
- Testimony is expected to be given orally, on the assumption that the spoken, not the written, word is a truer reflection of the state of mind of a witness
- In our culture, lawyers do not have to be wise; they need to be well briefed
- Indeed, I hope to persuade you that the decline of a print-based epistemology and the accompanying rise of a television-based epistemology has had grave consequences for public life, that we are getting sillier by the minute
- For one thing, its attention span would obviously have been extraordinary by current standards. Is there any audience of Americans today who could endure seven hours of talk? or five? or three? Especially without pictures of any kind? Second, these audiences must have had an equally extraordinary capacity to comprehend lengthy and complex sentences aurally.
- It is hard to imagine the present occupant of the White House being capable of constructing such clauses in similar circumstances. And if he were, he would surely do so at the risk of burdening the comprehension or concentration of his audience. People of a television culture need plain language both aurally and visually, and will even go so far as to require it in some circumstances by law
- From Erasmus in the sixteenth century to Elizabeth Eisenstein in the twentieth, almost every scholar who has grappled with the question of what reading does to one’s habits of mind has concluded that the process encourages rationality; that the sequential, propositional character of the written word fosters what Walter Ong calls the analytic management of knowledge
- It is no accident that the Age of Reason was coexistent with the growth of a print culture, first in Europe and then in America
- As late as 1890, advertising, still understood to consist of words, was regarded as an essentially serious and rational enterprise whose purpose was to convey information and make claims in propositional form. Advertising was, as Stephen Douglas said in another context, intended to appeal to understanding, not to passions
- By the turn of the century, advertisers no longer assumed rationality on the part of their potential customers. Advertising became one part depth psychology, one part aesthetic theory. Reason had to move itself to other arenas.

THE TYPOGRAPHIC MIND

- For one thing, as I have said, the printed word had a monopoly on both attention and intellect, there being no other means, besides the oral tradition, to have access to public knowledge. Public figures were known largely by their written words, for example, not by their looks or even their oratory. It is quite likely that most of the first fifteen presidents of the United States would not have been recognized had they passed the average citizen in the street
- Almost all of the characteristics we associate with mature discourse were amplified by typography, which has the strongest possible bias toward exposition: a sophisticated ability to think conceptually, deductively and sequentially; a high valuation of reason and order; an abhorrence of contradiction; a large capacity for detachment and objectivity; and a tolerance for delayed response.

**THE PEEK-A-BOO WORLD**

- It was not long until the fortunes of newspapers came to depend not on the quality or utility of the news they provided, but on how much, from what distances, and at what speed
- As Thoreau implied, telegraphy made relevance irrelevant. The abundant flow of information had very little or nothing to do with those to whom it was addressed; that is, with any social or intellectual context in which their lives were embedded. Coleridge’s famous line about water everywhere without a drop to drink may serve as a metaphor of a decontextualized information environment: In a sea of information, there was very little of it to use
- By generating an abundance of irrelevant information, it dramatically altered what may be called the information-action ratio.
- You may get a sense of what this means by asking yourself another series of questions: What steps do you plan to take to reduce the conflict in the Middle East? Or the rates of inflation, crime and unemployment? What are your plans for preserving the environment or reducing the risk of nuclear war? What do you plan to do about NATO, OPEC, the CIA, affirmative action, and the monstrous treatment of the Baha’is in Iran? I shall take the liberty of answering for you: You plan to do nothing about them
- **The news elicits from you a variety of opinions about which you can do nothing except to offer them as more news, about which you can do nothing.**
- A book is an attempt to make thought permanent and to contribute to the great conversation conducted by authors of the past
- The telegraph is suited only to the flashing of messages, each to be quickly replaced by a more up-to-date message. Facts push other facts into and then out of consciousness at speeds that neither permit nor require evaluation.
- Pictures, Gavriel Salomon has written, need to be recognized, words need to be understood. 6 By this he means that the photograph presents the world as object; language, the world as idea
- The photograph documents and celebrates the particularities of this infinite variety. Language makes them comprehensible
- The photograph also lacks a syntax, which deprives it of a capacity to argue with the world. As an objective slice of space-time, the photograph testifies that someone was there or something happened
- Language makes sense only when it is presented as a sequence of propositions. Meaning is distorted when a word or sentence is, as we say, taken out of context;
- Like telegraphy, photography recreates the world as a series of idiosyncratic events. There is no beginning, middle, or end in a world of photographs, as there is none implied by telegraphy
- The new focus on the image undermined traditional definitions of information, of news, and, to a large extent, of reality itself
- By the end of the nineteenth century, advertisers and newspapermen had discovered that a picture was not only worth a thousand words, but, where sales were concerned, was better. For countless Americans, seeing, not reading, became the basis for believing.
- It created an apparent context for the news of the day. And the news of the day created a context for the photograph.
- You will, in fact, have learned nothing (except perhaps to avoid strangers with photographs), and the illyx will fade from your mental landscape as though it had never been.
- Where people once sought information to manage the real contexts of their lives, now they had to invent contexts in which otherwise useless information might be put to some apparent use. The crossword puzzle is one such pseudo-context
- A pseudo-context is a structure invented to give fragmented and irrelevant information a seeming use
- The pseudo-context is the last refuge, so to say, of a culture overwhelmed by irrelevance, incoherence, and impotence
- a world that does not ask us, indeed, does not permit us to do anything; a world that is, like the child’s game of peek-a-boo, entirely self-contained. But like peek-a-boo, it is also endlessly entertaining.
- Television has achieved the status of meta-medium—an instrument that directs not only our knowledge of the world, but our knowledge of ways of knowing as well.
- television’s way of knowing is uncompromisingly hostile to typography’s way of knowing; that television’s conversations promote incoherence and triviality; that the phrase serious television is a contradiction in terms; and that television speaks in only one persistent voice—the voice of entertainment

**THE AGE OF SHOW BUSINESS**

- We might say that a technology is to a medium as the brain is to the mind. Like the brain, a technology is a physical apparatus. Like the mind, a medium is a use to which a physical apparatus is put
- The problem is not that television presents us with entertaining subject matter but that all subject matter is presented as entertaining, which is another issue altogether.
- A news show, to put it plainly, is a format for entertainment, not for education, reflection or catharsis

**“NOW…THIS”**

- I assume, for the same reason music is used in the theater and films—to create a mood and provide a leitmotif for the entertainment. If there were no music—as is the case when any television program is interrupted for a news flash—viewers would expect something truly alarming, possibly life-altering. But as long as the music is there as a frame for the program, the viewer is comforted to believe that there is nothing to be greatly alarmed about; that, in fact, the events that are reported have as much relation to reality as do scenes in a play.
- Viewers, after all, are partners with the newscasters in the Now … this culture, and they expect the newscaster to play out his or her role as a character who is marginally serious but who stays well clear of authentic understanding. The viewers, for their part, will not be caught contaminating their responses with a sense of reality, any more than an audience at a play would go scurrying to call home because a character on stage has said that a murderer is loose in the neighborhood.
- One can hardly overestimate the damage that such juxtapositions do to our sense of the world as a serious place. The damage is especially massive to youthful viewers who depend so much on television for their clues as to how to respond to the world. In watching television news, they, more than any other segment of the audience, are drawn into an epistemology based on the assumption that all reports of cruelty and death are greatly exaggerated and, in any case, not to be taken seriously or responded to sanely
- The result of all this is that Americans are the best entertained and quite likely the least well-informed people in the Western world
- What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of being informed by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this word almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information—information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing
- That is the way of typographic discourse, and typography is the universe I’m coming from, as they say. But they are coming from a different universe of discourse altogether: the Now … this world of television. The fundamental assumption of that world is not coherence but discontinuity. And in a world of discontinuities, contradiction is useless as a test of truth or merit, because contradiction does not exist
- Television programs, such as “Entertainment Tonight”, turn information about entertainers and celebrities into serious cultural content, so that the circle begins to close: Both the form and content of news become entertainment

**TEACHING AS AN AMUSING ACTIVITY**

- Teachers, from primary grades through college, are increasing the visual stimulation of their lessons; are reducing the amount of exposition their students must cope with; are relying less on reading and writing assignments; and are reluctantly concluding that the principal means by which student interest may be engaged is entertainment

**THE HUXLEYAN WARNING**

- What Huxley teaches is that in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate. In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.
