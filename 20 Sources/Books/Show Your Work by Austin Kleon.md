Kleon, Austin

## Summary

Be an amateur. Guilty pleasures don’t exist. Like you what you like and don’t let others opinions change what you like. Show your work. Make and website. Share something small everyday. START Learning More NOW. Learn as much as you can in a day.

## Favoriate Quotes

- Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough,” writes author Alain de Botton
- Don’t be jealous when the people you like do well—celebrate their victory as if it’s your own.
- His thinking is that we dedicate the first 25 years or so of our lives to learning, the next 40 to work, and the last 15 to retirement, so why not take 5 years off retirement and use them to break up the work years
- Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you’ll attract people who love that kind of stuff. It’s that simple

## Detailed Notes

### 1. You Don’t Have to Be a Genius.

- The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something.” Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing.
- Don’t worry, for now, about how you’ll make money or a career off it. Forget about being an expert or a professional, and wear your amateurism (your heart, your love) on your sleeve. Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.
- It’s for this reason that I read the obituaries every morning. Obituaries are like near-death experiences for cowards. Reading them is a way for me to think about death while also keeping it at arm’s length
- Reading about people who are dead now and did things with their lives makes me want to get up and do something decent with mine. Thinking about death every morning makes me want to live.

### 2. Think Process, Not Product.

- To all viewers but yourself, what matters is the product: the finished artwork. To you, and you alone, what matters is the process: the experience of shaping the artwork
- No one is going to give a damn about your résumé; they want to see what you have made with your own little fingers.”

### 3. Share Something Small Everyday.

- So forget about decades, forget about years, and forget about months. Focus on days
- The sun goes up; the sun goes down. I can handle that.
- A daily dispatch is even better than a résumé or a portfolio, because it shows what we’re working on right now
- I like the tagline at [dribbble.com](http://dribbble.com): “What are you working on?” Stick to that question and you’ll be good. Don’t show your lunch or your latte; show your work
- The same is true of our own work. The trouble is, we don’t always know what’s good and what sucks. That’s why it’s important to get things in front of others and see how they react

### 4. Open Up Your Cabinet of Curiosities.

- “But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer
- I don’t believe in guilty pleasures. If you f—ing like something, like it.
- We all love things that other people think are garbage. You have to have the courage to keep loving your garbage, because what makes us unique is the diversity and breadth of our influences, the unique ways in which we mix up the parts of culture others have deemed “high” and the “low.”
- When you find things you genuinely enjoy, don’t let anyone else make you feel bad about it.
- When you share your taste and your influences, have the guts to own all of it
- Attribution is all about providing context for what you’re sharing: what the work is, who made it, how they made it, when and where it was made, why you’re sharing it, why people should care about it, and where people can see some more work like it

### 5. Tell Good Stories.

- The driver of emotional value that their effect on any given object’s subjective value can actually be measured objectively.” First, they went out to thrift stores, flea markets, and yard sales and bought a bunch of “insignificant” objects for an average of $1.25 an object. Then, they hired a bunch of writers, both famous and not-so-famous, to invent a story “that attributed significance” to each object. Finally, they listed each object on eBay, using the invented stories as the object’s description, and whatever they had originally paid for the object as the auction’s starting price. By the end of the experiment, they had sold $128.74 worth of trinkets for $3,612.5
- Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful

### 6. Teach What You Know.

- The impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.

### 7. Don’t Turn Into Human Spam.

- Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you’ll attract people who love that kind of stuff. It’s that simple
- Vampires cannot be cured. Should you find yourself in the presence of a vampire, be like Brancusi, and banish it from your life forever

### 9. Sell Out.

- Don’t be jealous when the people you like do well—celebrate their victory as if it’s your own.
- Don’t be afraid to charge for your work, but put a price on it that you think is fair.
- Never ever add someone’s email address to your mailing list without her permission
- We don’t make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies.” —Walt Disney
- Above all, recognize that if you have had success, you have also had luck—and with luck comes obligation. You owe a debt, and not just to your gods. You owe a debt to the unlucky

### 10. Stick Around.

- Work is never finished, only abandoned
- Add all this together and you get a way of working I call chain-smoking. You avoid stalling out in your career by never losing momentum. Here’s how you do it: Instead of taking a break in between projects, waiting for feedback, and worrying about what’s next, use the end of one
- project to light up the next one
- His thinking is that we dedicate the first 25 years or so of our lives to learning, the next 40 to work, and the last 15 to retirement, so why not take 5 years off retirement and use them to break up the work years
- Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough,” writes author Alain de Botton
- When you get rid of old material, you push yourself further and come up with something better. When you throw out old work, what you’re really doing is making room for new work
- You have to have the courage to get rid of work and rethink things completely
