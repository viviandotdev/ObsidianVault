# Be Water
by Shannon Lee

**The Purpose of Life**
"In the flow" choosing to live life intentionally, instead of just occupying physical space in a class room you are actively participating the classroom and what is happening.

We often get stuck in routines or habits and just go about the day to do mindlessly without thinking about our actions and what we are doing with our time. But we should be more conscious. **We will live the life that we create through our actions.**

**The purpose in life is to become the most high-functioning and happy person you can be.** With this goal every moment can be an opportunity to full fill this purpose.
Life is not about counting the number accomplishments but the continuous engagement in life as a process of unlimited growth

**Emptying your Mind**

**Experimentation in life**
**Research your own experience. Reject what is useless. Accept what is useful. And add what is essentially your own -Bruce Lee**
Run small experiments on habits, and routines. Figure out what routines and systems work for you and discard and remove things that don't work.
For example when Bruce Lee started experimenting with weightlifting he noticed he was getting stronger however he was also getting bulky which was not helping his mobility. Therefore he modified weightlifting to higher reps and lower weights. Therefore he could keep all the strength benefits of weightlifting while also being lean.

As you investigate and stick with the problem, I encourage you to utilize the tool of journaling or writing as a way of tracking your discoveries and organizing your thoughts. Don’t just think your thoughts; write them down. Physically track what you love, what you’re curious about, your experiments, your ideas, your dreams

 Bruce Lee charted his progress. He set goals. He created reminders and exercises and tools for his growth—physically, mentally, and spiritually.

Current Systems
1. Drawing- Draw a hand (90 minutes)
2. Learning- Create 1 book summary a week (60 Minutes)
3. System Design- Each weak design a new system (30 Minutes)
4. Workout- 90 minutes in the morning (45 minutes listening to a book)
5. Coding- Book Project (90 minutes)

**Action**
Action create more action "An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion". We want to be object in motion.
Make sure you have all the small things in order before you tackle the bigger things you want in life.
Even if you don't know what are the big things you want you can always work on tackling the small things as you figure out what you truly want.
- Building you body is the first thing you should do.

Translate thought into action quickly. Your goal is to not to not fail your goal is to fail through as many bad ideas as possible so you can take those lessons for your next success.

**Cultivation**
When your mind is cultivated you no longer need to position yourself before you speak or act. **You just speak or act with trust that you are being the most realized version of yourself in the moment of your action**

"We remove our mental blocks, our obsessive thoughts, our calculating mind, our need to be better than, our need to look good in front of, and we just are—unapologetically, sincerely, honestly, fully ourselves.""

**Stage to Achieve Cultivation**
1. Partiality: When are at this stage we are not aware of our thoughts, emotions and actions. During this phase we get defensive and are unwilling to learn from and see other people's views
2. Fluidity- At this state we are open to learning and becoming a better version of ourself.
3. Emptiness- At this stage we have gotten so good that we no longer have to think again. In martial arts this happens when we have mastered a punch so that we no longer need to think about all the components of a punch we just punch. "The height of technique is to have no technique"
4. Jeet Kune Do- This last stage is when a punch is not only a skilled punch but it is now your punch. During this stage you are a fully expressed human.

To obtain wholeness we must work from within, we must work on being content and happy within and bring this into all the things we want to do. We don’t need to spend all our time making the external stuff of our lives look a certain way so that we can then be joyful and peaceful and powerful.
