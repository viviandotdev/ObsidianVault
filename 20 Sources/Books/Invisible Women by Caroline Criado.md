##  Invisible Women


Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men is a 2019 book by British feminist author Caroline Criado Perez

#### Default Male
In anatomy textbooks women are presented as a variation of standard humanity. The Ancient Greeks saw the female as 'mutilated male' body. The female was the male 'turned outside in'
#### Women were the first programmers
Women were actually the first computer programmers. ENIAC, the world’s first fully functional digital computer was programmed by women. Women were naturals at programming since they were able to patient and handle details. But as employers started to realize that programming required advanced problem solving skills, the brilliance bias took effect and industry leaders started to train men and developed hiring tools that were biased against women.
Industry leaders used multiple choice tests with mathematical trivia that were irrelevant to programming but were the type of maths that were more likely to be studied in school by men.

#### Promotions
Women are less likely to ask for promotions than men is because men are more likely to ask for promotions even if they are not qualified. Women can accurately asses their intelligence whereas men often over estimate their intelligence.

#### Health
There is gender data gap in occupational health research.
Much of the research done on chemicals is through absorption of the skin. However much on this research is done on men with much thicker skin than females. Therefore we are unclear

Even in female dominated industries such as nail salons there is little or no research on how the chemicals that these workers come in contact with every day affects their health. Recent studies have found that Endocrine disrupting chemicals can be harmful and is linked to breast cancer is women. However there still seems to be little to no regulation of this chemical in everyday products such as nail polish, perfumes and skin moisturizers.



#### Sexual Harassment
Research has found that nurses are subjected to "more acts of violence than police officers or prison guards".
Workplace violence is healthcare is a ubiquitous problem that has been largely ignored.


#### One size Fits men
Gender Neutral products are designed to advantageous to men.
The standard piano keyboard is designed for the handspan of a man. The most successful pianists have large hand spans and are mostly men.
The reason screen sizes of phones were getting bigger to make it more convenient for men.
**Motion Sickness in Cars**
There are also sex differences in the way the body sways however there is no research on how and when the female body sways. The headrest is the car is supposed to be designed to help alleviate motion sickness in cars as y our body sways. However for women the headrest is often designed to be at the wrong height or. wrong angle which explains why women experience more motion sickness in cars.
**Car Deaths**
Women are 17% more likely to due in a car crash than men.
Women need to sit further forward than men while driving however this is not standard seating position which puts us at a greater risk of injury.
In addition the most commonly used crash test dummies were based on the male body
#### Gender data Gap Technology

Due to the gender data gap speech recognition technology often has difficulty recognizing female voices because of the lack of female voice the database it is trained on.

Sports and health products are also designed to only men in the mind. Most treadmills do not accurately count the calories for women.

Men are more likely to rely on motion parallax for depth perception, while women rely on shape-from-shading. The VR 3D environments were designed to send out signals that benefit. male perceptions. This is why women experience more motion sickness than men when using these technologies.

#### Gender Data Gap in Science
The reason behind the lack of data and inclusion of women in research was because female bodies were argued to be too complex , variable and therefore too costly to be tested on.

Women are also not even included in the animal studies on human prevalent diseases. Women are more likely to suffer from depression than men but animal studies on brain disorders are more likely to be done on male animals.


#### Drugs
Women are often not included in test trials for generic drugs which account for 80% of the prescriptions in the united states .
The FDA reported that the second most common adverse drug reaction in women is that the drug does not work for them. In addition women are more likely to be hospitalized following a adverse drug reaction than men.
Although there are clear sex differences in how these drugs affect men a women the vast majority of drugs continue to use gender-neutral dosages which puts women at risk of an overdose.
Sea Diffs
At a most basic level, women tend to have a higher body-fat percentage than men, which, along with the fact that blood flow to fat tissue is greater in women (for men it’s greater to skeletal muscle) can affect how they metabolise certain drugs.

 Kidney filtering is also faster in men, meaning some renally excreted medications (for example digoxin – a heart medication) ‘may require a dosage adjustment

When looking at mortality rates from 1992-2006 the study found that although women have longer lives that have less active years. From this data it also showed that the active years of a women have stayed the same however the active years of a man has been increasing. However there is no data that explains why this is happening.
