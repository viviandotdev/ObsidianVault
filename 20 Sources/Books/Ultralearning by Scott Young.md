## Ultralearning

- **Why Ultralearning Matters**
    - Ultralearning-is a strategy for aggressive, self-directed learning.
    - **Average is Over:**
        - because of automation, we are moving toward a world where only the top-performers do a lot better. Being average is no longer sufficient.
        - the advance in computerization means that median-skilled jobs such as, clerks, bookkeepers are being replaced.
            - New jobs to replace these jobs are either high skilled jobs (engineers, programmers, designers) or low skilled jobs (retail workers, customer service agents)

    **Education: Tuition is to High**

    - College prices are rises much faster than inflation.

    **Accelerate, Transition and Rescue Your Career with UltraLearning**

    - The ability to learn heard things quickly is going to very valuable.

**Principles of Ultralearning**

Principles allow you to solve problems, even those you may have never encountered before, in a way that a recipe or mechanical procedure cannot

### MetaLearning: First Draw a Map
1. MetaLearning is being able to see how a subject works, what kinds of skills and information must be mastered, and what methods are available to do so more effectively is at the heart of success of all ultralearning projects
        - The difference between the two types of bilingual speakers mostly came down to metalearning: one group had content knowledge of the language, but **the group that took classes also had knowledge about how information in a language is structured.**
    2. How to Draw Your Map: Breakdown Metalearning Research for a Specific Project to 3 Questions
        1. WHY are you learning this?
            1. Instrumental learning projects are those you’re learning with the purpose of achieving a different, nonlearning result
            2. Intrinsic projects are those that you’re pursuing for their own sake
                1. Intrinsic doesn’t mean useless
            3. Reach out to experts to ask if your project will help you toward your goal.
                1. Most experts are more than willing to offer advice and are flattered by the thought that someone wants to learn from their experience. The key is to write a simple, to-the-point email, explaining why you’re reaching out to them and asking if they could spare fifteen minutes to answer some simple questions. Make the email concise and nonthreatening. Don’t ask for more than fifteen minutes or for ongoing mentorship.
        2. What are you Learning?
            1. Think about what you want to learn and separate it into.
                1. Concepts- understood
                2. Facts- memorized
                3. Procedures- practiced
        3. How are you Learning it?
            1. For academic subjects look at circula used at universities.
            2. For nonacademic subjects search online for people who have learning the skill before and learn about how they learned it.
            3. Then exclude the elements the curriculum that do not align with your goals.
            4. How much planing should you do?
                1. Use about 10% of the time you expect to be learning this subject.
                    1. 6 months- 4 hours a week= 100 hours.
                        1. therefore spend 10 hours researching.
### Focus: Sharpen your Kinfe*
-  great intellectual accomplishments come from our ability to focus deeply and quickly.
    - work on lengthening the time you can focus.

    **Problems with Focusing**

    - Procrastinating

        - procrastination is usually unconscious. recognizing you are procrastinating is the first step
        - convince yourself to spend only 5 minutes on the task before you can stop and do something else.
            - use the pomodoro technique- to practice increasing lengths of focus.
    - **Failing to sustain focus**

        - flow- state of mind of being "in the zone". you stop being distracted by your own thoughts and your mind is completely absorbed by the task.
        - 50 min - 1 hour then a break in between
            - Distractions
                1. your environment
                2. your task-certain tasks are harder to focus on. i find it harder to focus reading than watching a lecture.
                    1. modify the task so it requires more focus.
                        1. when reading jot down notes and try to reexplain hard concepts.
                3. Your Mind
                    1. negative emotions, restlessness
                        1. allow negative feelings to pass.
                        2. "learn to let it arise, note it, and release it or let it go"
                            1. although it may seem like continuing to work is pointless because you are getting nothing them, you are strengthening your ability to persist on this task is useful even if you don't accomplish much.
    - **The right kind of focus**

        - find the optimal degree of focus to maximize your learning.
        - more complex tasks require more relaxed focus. when you get stuck it is best to take a break from the problem. this can widen your consciousness earlier can conjoin and you can make new discoveries.
### Directness: Go Straight Ahead

- it is the idea of learning being tied closely to the situation or context you want to use it in.
    - spend a lot of time doing that thing you want to become good at.
        - try to create the "real" situation
            - Roger Craig when practicing rather than going on Wikipedia and memorizing obscure facts he used the data from past jeopardy games to simulate the game.

    **Transfer: Education's Dirty Secret**

    - when have the ability to transfer what you learn in a classroom in a another context such are real-life.
        - we expect high-school student who take college level courses to do better in college. however this was found to be not the case.

    **How to learn Directly**

    1. Project Based Learning
        1. organize your learning around producing something.
        2. in class you can spend a lot of time taking notes but not achieving your goal.
            1. example- want to learn about blockchain→ the project would be to write a thesis paper on the topic.
    2. Immersive Learning
        1. the process of surrounding yourself with the target environment where the skill is practiced.
    3. Flight learning simulator
        1. where directness is impossible- simulate a direct approach will transfer much better.
    4. Overkill approach
        1. aiming for a particular test, performance or challenge that will be above the skill level you require.
            1. ex.- preparing for a language exam or a competition.

### Drill Attack: Your Weakest Point

drills- simplify the skills enough so you can focus your cognitive resources on a single aspect.

direct-then drill- first practice the skill directly by figuring out how the skill will be used and try to match that situation as close as possible. then analyze the skill and isolate the components that are difficult to improve

    **Tactics for Designing Drills**

    Time Slicing- isolate a slice of time for a longer sequence of actions

    musicians will identify the hardest part of a piece and practice it perfectly before integrating it back into the entire song.

    Cognitive Components-

    drill only once component when in practice others will be applied at the same time.

    in Chinese learning tones, practice pronouncing pairs of words with different tones and recording himself. he could practice producing different tones without the distraction of remembering what the words mean or how to form grammatically correct sentences.

    The Copycat-

    do the work of others.

    when drawing not only did he draw from photos he also drew from other drawings other people had done. this helped him focus on simplifying decisions on how to frame a scene and which details to include.

    Magnifying Class Method

    spend more time on the component of a skill you wouldn't otherwise

    to improve research ability spend more time doing researching than you previously would have

    Prerequisite chaining

    when a skill is too hard it may be cause you don't have all the prerequisites for it. go back and learn the foundational topics and repeat to fill your gaps.

### Retrieval: Test to Learn

whether you are ready or not retrieval practice is better.
**How to practice**

- Flashcards
	- association between question and answers
- Free recall
	- after reading a book or watching a lecture try to right down everything you learned.
- Question-book method
	- another strategy for taking notes is to rephrase your notes as questions to be answered later.
	- focus on asking questions about big ideas about a section.
- Self generated challenges
	- create a list of challenges
- closed-book learning
	- cut off your ability to look things up. you practice making the information knowledge stored in your head rather that inside of a reference manual.
		- creating concepts maps from your knowledge.
### Feedback: Don't Dodge the Punches*

feedback can be negative if it is processed inappropriately or failed to provide useful information.

- **types of feedback-**

	outcome- tells you how well you are doing but offers no ideas as to what you're doing better or worse.

	- provide motivation
	- show you whats working

	informational- feedback without correction

	- this feedback tells you what you're doing wrong, but doesn't necessarily tell you how to fix it.
		- program errors let you know something is wrong. if the errors diminish or increase she can use to this to fix her problem.

	corrective- feedback with correction

	- requires a coach.
- **how quick should feedback be?**

	- feedback is better when it is faster because it enables quicker recognition of mistakes.
		- however too soon feedback will effectively turn to passive review.
		- for hard problems- set a timer to encourage to think hard on a difficult problem before giving up to look at the correct answer.
- **How to improve feedback**

	**noise cancellation**

	feedback can come in the form of noise. learn to block out the noise and only take the useful information.

	**hitting difficulty sweet spot.**

	**adjust your environment so they cannot predict whether they will succeed or fail.**

	when you fail too often- simplifying the problem

	if you fail too little- make the task harder.

	avoid situations that make you feel good or bad about your performance.

	**meta feedback**

	**feedback of the overall strategy you are using to learn.**

	learning rate- information on how fast your learning or how fast you are improving in one aspect of your skill.

	**rapid feedback**

	getting a lot more of it more often.

	helps overcome the fear of receiving feedback.


### **Retention: Don't Fill a Leaky Bucket**

- the best french scrabble player in the world didn't even know french. he would spend hours biking, during this time he was practicing recalling the combinations of letters in his head.
- to be good at scrabble you don't need to learn the language.
- Forgetting curve
- Review notes
- Immediately after
- 24 hours
- 1 week
- 1 month
- Prevent Forgetting
	- Spaced repetition systems
		- spend ten hours studying vs. studying for 1 hours over 10 days.
	- Procedurlization: Automatic will Endure
		- procedural knowledge is stored for longer
			- ex. procedural skills such as remembering how to bike is less likely to be forgotten than knowledge that require explicit recall.
			- most skills start off as declarative but become more procedural as you practice it more.
	- over learning
		- additional practice, beyond what is required to perform adequately.
		- moving up a level to a more advanced skill enabled the earlier skill to be over learned, thus preventing some forgetting.
			- ex. math
				- one group took algebra and was retested a few years later.
				- one group also took calculus.
				- the 2nd group had higher retention of algebra because those skills were being overlearned.
	- mnemonics
		- the study and development of systems for improving and assisting the memory.

### **Intuition: Dig Deep Before Building up**

- Richard Feyman was a magician, mathematician and physist. although his IQ was only 125, compared to the average of 115, he had the ability to solve extremely difficult problems.
	- **Don't Give up on Hard Problems**
		- when you feel like giving up and you can't solve the problem, try setting a timer for another 10 minutes to push yourself a bit further.
	- **Prove things to understand them**
		- Rather ran accepting proofs (Pythagoras's Theorem) as true he wanted to learn it for him self. he re-created the proof to better understand it.
		- when trying to draw a bicycle from memory many people failed showing they don't understand the object as much as they thought.
	- **Always start with Concrete examples**
		- **deeper processing enhances intuition and understanding.**
			- examples:
				- 2 groups: 1 group was told to be given a test group 2 was told to look at the words using an orienting technique
					- they were told to look if the words contained the letter 'e', and if the words were pleasant or not.
					- this deeper processing retained more info, opposed to the group motivated by the test.
	- **Dunning Kruger effect-** when someone with inadequate understanding of a subject believes he or she possesses more knowledge than the people who actually do.
		- without knowledge on the subject you lack the ability to asses your own abilities.
- Feynman Technique
	- write down a concept you want to understand.
	- then below it write it down as if you were _explaini_ng it to someone who has no idea what it is.
		1. a concept ask yourself how to teach this to someone who has never heard of it
		2. it its a problem explain how to solve it and why the procedure makes sense.
	- when stuck go bank to the notes to find the answer.

### **Experimentation: Explore outside your Comfort Zone**


- Van Goh started art when he was in his mid 20s. He self taught him-self through experimentation. the experimented with materials, methods and the philosophies behind the art.

    - Difference Between Novice and Master
        - the master knows the best and most efficient way to solve a problem what will cause less issues later on.

    **Types of Experimentation**

    1. Experiment with Learning Resources
        1. the resources used to learning,
            1. following courses, watching artists.
        2. Experiment with Technique
            1. pick a subtopic within the skill you are trying to cultivate and spend time learning it aggressively then evaluate your progress
        3. Experimenting with Style
            1. become aware of the different styles that exist.

    **How to Experiment**

    - Copy then create
        - emulate an example you appreciate
        - you can deconstruct the art wot see why it works.
        - simplifies the choices available to you.
        - highlights the things the person did exceptionally well.
    - Compare methods sides by side
        - try learning in 2 different methods and varying only one condition to see what the impact is.
            - ex. testing if mnemonics works. 2 decks studying 1 deck with mnemonics and the other without.
    - Introduce new constraints
        - how can you add limitations to force yourself to develop new capacities?
    - find your superpower in the hybrid of unrelated skills.
        - you may not be the best engineer.
            - but you can be one of the best engineers and public speakers.
    - explore the extremes
        - pushing your skills outside the normal conventions.
