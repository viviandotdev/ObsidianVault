### Summary/High Level Thoughts

This book discusses “flow” and how it can be achieved to help use live a happier and more meaningful work and life.

### Favoriate Quotes:

- The universe is not hostile, nor yet is it friendly, in the words of J. H. Holmes. It is simply indifferent.
- We are always getting to live but never living - Ralph Waldo Emerson
- I would rather discover one true cause than gain the kingdom of Persia.
- Stress exists only if we experience it; it takes the most extreme objective conditions to cause it directly.
- We do not run risks acting on our beliefs, but occupy hours each day watching actors who pretend to have adventures, engaged in mock-meaningful action.
- Those have most power to hurt us that we love. - John Fletcher
- Reform yourself. That way there will be one less rascal in the world. The advice is still valid. Those who try to make life better for everyone without having learned to control their own lives first usually end up making things worse all around

### Detailed Notes:

Chapter 1- **HAPPINESS REVISITED**

THE SHIELDS OF CULTURE

- Humankind has advanced very far in terms of technology and material powers however we have not advanced in improving the content of experience.

RECLAIMING EXPERIENCE

- We cannot deny nature however we can improve it.

PATHS OF LIBERATION

- Progress is relatively fast in fields that apply knowledge to the material world, such as physics or genetics. But it is painfully slow when knowledge is to be applied to modify our own habits and desires

Chapter 2- **THE ANATOMY OF CONSCIOUSNESS**

- consciousness is intentionally ordered information that we can manipulate and use.

ATTENTION AS PSYCHIC ENERGY

- **Attention** is like energy in that without it no work can be done, and in doing work it is dissipated. We create ourselves by how we invest this energy
- Whenever information disrupts consciousness by threatening its goals we have a condition of inner disorder, or **psychic entropy**, a disorganization of the self that impairs its effectiveness.
- **Flow** is when attention freely used to help us pursue our goals without entropy.

COMPLEXITY AND THE GROWTH OF THE SELF

- **Differentiation**- being unique. (an only differentiated self risks egotism)
- **Integration-** union with other people. (an only integrated self lacks autonomous individuality)

To achieve a complex self we must learn to combine these opposite tendencies.

Chapter 3- ENJOYMENT AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE

PLEASURE AND ENJOYMENT

- Pleasure- helps maintain order however does not add complexity to the self. (no psychic energy is needed- ex. eating)
- Enjoyment- in addition to meeting a prior expectation or satisfied a need or desire they also go beyond what they are expected to do and achieved something unexpected. (enormous amounts of psychic energy is needed)

THE ELEMENTS OF ENJOYMENT

- Enjoyment occurs at the boundary between boredom and anxiety.
- Regular feedback is that is logically related to the goal is crucial for enjoyment.
- Loss of self-consciousness into a self-transcendence where they feel their boundaries of our being being pushed forward.
- After the activity ends the self-conscious returns and the self the person reflects upon is no longer the same as the self that existed before the flow experience. This new self has new skills and fresh achievements.

THE AUTOTELIC EXPERIENCE

- autotelic- a person paying attention to the activity for its own sake. In a non-autotelic experience the attention is focused on the consequences.
- things that we were initially forced to do can become rewarding.
- Enjoyable activities are not natural. They require effort that initially one is reluctant to make. However once the activity starts to provide feedback related to their goal it become intrinsically rewarding.

Chapter 4

THE CONDITIONS OF FLOW

- optimal experience- when one’s skills are good enough to tackle the challenges at hand.

THE AUTOTELIC PERSONALITY

In family context

- **Clarity -** one feels that they know that their parents expect from them
- **Centering-** the perception that their parents are interested in what they are doing.
- **Choice-** children feel they have may possibilities to choose.
- **Commitment-** the child feels comfortable enough to become unselfconsciously involved in their interest.
- **Challenge-** the parents continues to provide complex opportunities for their child.

THE PEOPLE OF FLOW

- By simply using one’s imagination one can preserve their sanity and stay physically capable.

A prisoner who imagined playing eighteen holes , carefully choose his clubs and approach and varying the course was able to paly a superb game after his release. Although he was in an emaciated condition.

Chapter 5- THE BODY IN FLOW

Each of our senses offers an almost unlimited amount of enjoyment, but only to persons who work to develop the skills they require. To those who do not, the body remains indeed a lump of rather inexpensive flesh

HIGHER, FASTER, STRONGER

Olympians do not have an exclusive gift in finding enjoyment in pushing performance beyond existing boundaries.

The essential steps in this process are:

1. Set an overall goal and as many sub-goals as possible.
2. Find ways to measure progress in the terms of the goals.
3. Concentrate on what one is doing and continuously make finer and finer distinctions in the activity.
4. Develop skills to interact when new opportunities that become available.
5. If the activity becomes boring raise the stakes.

- Enjoyment, as we have seen, does not depend on what you do, but rather on how you do it.

THE FLOW OF MUSIC

- We are particularly sensitive to the rhythm of the drums or the bass, which some contend is supposed to remind the listener of the mother’s throbbing heart first heard in the womb
- Learning to produce harmonious sounds is not only enjoyable, but like the mastery of any complex skill, it also helps strengthen the self

THE JOYS OF TASTING

- If a person learns to control his instinctual desires, not because he has to, but because he wants to, he can enjoy himself without becoming addicted

Chapter 6- THE FLOW OF THOUGHT

**Entropy** is the normal state of consciousness—a condition that is neither useful nor enjoyable.

Therefore people will do anything to avoid this state through constant distraction.

THE MOTHER OF SCIENCE

- A person who has control over her conscious can always amuse herself by finding meaning in her thoughts. She is more **cherished** because her memory is stocked with information that she can use to **help bring order to the minds of those who she interacts with.**
- Others need external stimulation-TV or drugs- to stop their minds from drifting into chaos.

THE PLAY OF WORDS

**Our sense of the universe is held together by conversation**-

By recognizing an acquaintance through simple interaction such as “Nice Day” I achieve many unvoiced goals.

- I express my willingness to be friendly.
- I reaffirm the basic rules of interaction in our culture. Talking about the weather is a safe way to establish contact between people.
- My emphasizing the weather is nice I imply niceness is a desirable attribute.

His reply “Yeah it’s great, is’t is?”

- This keeps my mind in order.

Without these obvious restatements people will doubt the reality of the world they live in.

**Writing is never is waste of time.**

- Writing gives the mind a disciplined means of expression.
- Allows one to record events and experiences so they can be easily recalled in the future. It improves the quality of life and frees us from the chaos in the present by allowing us to reflect on the past.
- It is a way to analyze and understand one’s experiences and brings order to them.

Chapter 7- WORK AS FLOW

1. AUTOTELIC WORKERS- are people who can create flow experiences even in the most barren environment—an almost inhumane workplace.
2. AUTOTELIC JOBS- are jobs inherently resembles a game—with variety, appropriate and flexible challenges, clear goals, and immediate feedback—the more enjoyable it will be regardless of the worker’s level of development

THE PARADOX OF WORK

1. Subjects report that they the most positive experiences while on the job. From this response one would assume that they wish to be working.
2. However, people generally say they would prefer to not be working.

The contrast is also true. When people are enjoying their hard earned leisure people actually report lower moods. However they wish for more leisure.

THE WASTE OF FREE TIME

Most jobs and many leisure activities—especially those involving the passive consumption of mass media—are not designed to make us happy and strong. Their purpose is to make money for someone else.

Chapter 8- ENJOYING SOLITUDE AND OTHER PEOPLE

THE CONFLICT BETWEEN BEING ALONE AND BEING WITH OTHERS

human relations are malleable, and if a person has the appropriate skills their rules can be transformed.

THE PAIN OF LONELINESS

- Even pain is better than the chaos that seeps into an unfocused mind. Hurting oneself, whether physically or emotionally, ensures that attention can be focused on something that, although painful, is at least controllable—since we are the ones causing it

FLOW AND THE FAMILY

- The frequency of murder is much higher among family members than among unrelated people. Child abuse and incestuous sexual molestation, once thought to be rare deviations from the norm, apparently occur much more often than anyone had previously suspected.
- Early emotional security may well be one of the conditions that helps develop an autotelic personality in children. Without this, it is difficult to let go of the self long enough to experience flow.

ENJOYING FRIENDS

- A person who lives only by instrumental actions without experiencing the spontaneous flow of expressivity eventually becomes indistinguishable from a robot who has been programmed by aliens to mimic human behavior.
- When people are asked about their warmest memories, they usually remember holidays and vacations spent with relatives. Friends are mentioned more often in contexts of excitement, discovery, and adventure

Chapter 9- CHEATING CHAOS

Coping with Stress- Of all the virtues we can learn no trait is more useful, more essential for survival, and more likely to improve the quality of life than the ability to transform adversity into an enjoyable challenge

THE POWER OF DISSIPATIVE STRUCTURES

We naturally draw our psychic energy inward when faced with threat. However this compromises our ability to cope and isolates us from the rest of the world.

By staying in touch with what is going on we are able to see the bigger picture and see new possibilities emerge.

THE AUTOTELIC SELF: A SUMMARY

A person who is never bored, seldom anxious, involved with what goes on, and in flow most of the time may be said to have an autotelic self. The term literally means a self that has self-contained goals,

Involvement is greatly facilitated by the ability to concentrate. People who suffer from attentional disorders, who cannot keep their minds from wandering, always feel left out of the flow of life

In the long run, however, looking at the world exclusively from the little window that one’s self affords is always limiting. Even the most highly respected physicist, artist, or politician becomes a hollow bore and ceases to enjoy life if all he can interest himself in is his limited role in the universe.

They transform the entirety of life into a single flow activity, with unified goals that provide constant purpose.

1. Setting goals- they can define goals and systems that guide them to reach their specific goal.
2. Immersion into the activity- they become deeply involved in the activity at hand .
3. Attention- Concentration on the task can be maintained through constant inputs of attention.
4. Enjoy the immediate experience.- they can enjoy life even in adversity. They have control and which requires determination and discipline.

Chapter 10

THE MAKING OF MEANING

- What this involves is turning all life into a unified flow experience. If a person sets out to achieve a difficult enough goal, from which all other goals logically follow, and if he or she invests all energy in developing skills to reach that goal, then actions and feelings will be in harmony, and the separate parts of life will fit together—and each activity will make sense in the present, as well as in view of the past and of the future. In such a way, it is possible to give meaning to one’s entire life.
- It is true that life has no meaning, if by that we mean a supreme goal built into the fabric of nature and human experience, a goal that is valid for every individual. But it does not follow that life cannot be given meaning.

WHAT MEANING MEANS

- In this sense the answer to the old riddle “What is the meaning of life?” turns out to be astonishingly simple. The meaning of life is meaning: whatever it is, wherever it comes from, a unified purpose is what gives meaning to life.

FORGING RESOLVE

- The same is true of all flow experiences: there is a mutual relationship between goals and the effort they require. Goals justify the effort they demand at the outset, but later it is the effort that justifies the goal.
- Activity and reflection should ideally complement and support each other. Action by itself is blind, reflection impotent. Before investing great amounts of energy in a goal, it pays to raise the fundamental questions: Is this something I really want to do? Is it something I enjoy doing? Am I likely to enjoy it in the foreseeable future? Is the price that I—and others—will have to pay worth it? Will I be able to live with myself if I accomplish it?

THE UNIFICATION OF MEANING IN LIFE THEMES

- **authentic projects**- themes of a person who realizes choices are free.
- (discovered life themes)- they are products of a personal struggles and have less social legitimacy because they are novel. They can be regarded as crazy. Theses are freshly discovered and freely chosen by the individual.
- **inauthentic projects**- themes of a person who chooses them because they are what she feels ought to be done. They are what everyone else is doing.
- What transforms the consequences of a traumatic event into a challenge that gives meaning to life is dissipative structure, or the ability to draw order from disorder.
