# The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

- British Cycling was has never won the Tour De France. The coach decided to make small 1 percent changes such are making the seats more comfortable, rubbing alcohol on tires to improve grip and testing various fabrics in the wind tunnels. Hundreds of the these small improvements dramatically changed their outcome in the next Tour De France.
- However your habits can also compound against you leading.

- You must continuously be upgrading yourself to expand your identity.
- Habits help upgrade your beliefs about yourself. They give you more confidence on who you are.

## How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

- The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits.

**The 1st law (Cue):** Make it obvious.

**The 2nd law (Craving):** Make it attractive.

**The 3rd law (Response):** Make it easy.

**The 4th law (Reward):** Make it satisfying.

We can invert these laws to learn how to break a habit

**Inversion of the 1st law (Cue):** Make it invisible.

**Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving):** Make it unattractive.

**Inversion of the 3rd law (Response):** Make it difficult.

**Inversion of the 4th law (Reward):** Make it unsatisfying.

## Make it Obvious

1. **Pointing-and-Calling**
    1. this was tactic used by Japanese Train Operators who pointed at different and called out commands for each action. This significantly reduced the number of errors and improved the safety of the railway system
    2. by making the the unconscious, conscious you become more aware of your actions therefore giving you the ability to change them.
    3. the Habits Scorecard is a list of your daily habits. mark each habit as positive, negative or neutral.
2. **Cues**
    - Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.
        - The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
        - Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.
    - The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]
3. **Environment**
    - Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
    - Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.
        - If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room.
    - It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.
4. **Self-Control**
    - Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
    - People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
    - One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
    - Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.

## Make it Attractive

**How to make habits irresistible.**

- Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.
- It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.
- Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you _want_ to do with an action you _need_ to do

The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:

1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].
    1. ex.: After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).
    2. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).

T**he Role of family and Friends**

- We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because **we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe**.
- Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.
    - a club

**how to find and fix the causes of your bad habits.**

- Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.

- motivation ritual

    practice associating your habit with something you enjoy.

    “My focus and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while writing. I don’t even have to play any music.” He was conditioned himself to linking putting on headphones with increased focus work.


## Make it easy

**Walk Slowly but Never Backward**

- The most ****effective form of learning is practice, not planning.

- Focus on taking action, not being in motion.

- The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the **number of times you have performed it.**

    eventually it becomes automatic and you no longer think about it. frequency>time


**The Law of Least Effort**

- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.

    - Want to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and water bottle ahead of time.
- Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.

    - habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life.

        - ex: saying play some country music is easier than pulling out his phone and choosing a song.

        **Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion. This is because humans will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.**

- Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.


**The 2 minute rule**

- Many **habits occur at decisive moments—**choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.

    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/38713022-ae12-440f-b21f-63d171e558a3/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/38713022-ae12-440f-b21f-63d171e558a3/Untitled.png)

- The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”

    - “Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”
    - “Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”
    - “Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”
- Standardize before you optimize. **You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.**


**Inversion of 3rd Law**

- Make it difficult.

    **Productivity**

    1. Turn off notifications and mute group chats.
    2. Set your phone to silent.
    3. Use email filters to clear up your inbox.
    4. Delete games and social media apps on your phone.
- When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet.

    - Personal finance: Employees can save for retirement with an automatic wage deduction.
    - Cooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery shopping.
    - Productivity: Social media browsing can be cut off with a website blocker.

## The 4th Law: Make it Satisfying

**Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change:**

- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.
- The human brain evolved to **prioritize immediate reward**s over delayed rewards.
- **The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: _What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided._**
    - soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a refreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit
- The first three laws of behavior change—_make it obvious, make it attractive,_ and _make it easy_—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—_make it satisfying_—**increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.**

**How to Stick to Good Habits.**

- One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.
- A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar.
- Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.
- Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.
- Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.
    - If one measurement is not showing results there are other ways you can see progress in your habits.
        - This is why **nonscale victories** can be effective for weight loss. The number on the scale may be stubborn, so if you focus solely on that number, your motivation will sag. But you may notice that your skin looks better or you wake up earlier or your sex drive got a boost. All of these are valid ways to track your improvement

**Accountability**

- Make it unsatisfying
- An accountability partner can create an **immediate cost to inaction**. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.
- A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.
    - He should wake up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t malfunction.”
- **Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.**

## Advanced Tactics

**The Truth about Talent**

- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.
- Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.
- **Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.**
- When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? **The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.**

**The Goldilocks Rules**

- The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.
- The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.
    - The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you don’t. You need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to experience desire.
    - "Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming."
- Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.
    - Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.

**The Downside of Habits**

- The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.
    - they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world is shifting around us
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
- Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.
    - without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process of determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday.
