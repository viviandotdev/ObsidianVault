# Attached
by Amir Levine

## Top  Quotes
- **Our partners powerfully affect our ability to thrive in the world. Not only do they influence how we feel about ourselves, but also the degree to which we believe in ourselves and whether we will attempt to achieve our hopes and dreams.**
### Summary
There are 3 different attachment styles and each one differs in:
	• their view of intimacy and togetherness
	• the way they deal with conflict
	• their attitude toward sex
	• their ability to communicate their wishes and needs
	• their expectations from their partner and the relationship
Our attachment styles are likely determine by the way we were cared for, parents who were **sensitive** and **available** lead to a **secure** attachment style, parents we are **unresponsive** and distant creates an **avoidant** attachment style and parents we are **inconsistently** responsive lead to an **anxious** attachment style.

**Anxious Attachment Style**
- Crave intimacy
- The study showed that people with an anxious attachment style tend to jump to conclusions very quickly, and when they do, they tend to misinterpret people’s emotional state.
- If you're **anxious**, you should be dating someone **secure**

**Avoidant Attachment Style**
- Equate intimacy with the lost of independence
- Avoidant, it appears, are quick to think negatively  about their partners, seeing them as needy and overly dependent”
- When avoidant reach a low point in their life, because of severe loneliness, or a life-altering experience they can change their way of thinking.

**Secure Attachment Style**
- Feel comfortable with intimacy
- Expect their partners to be loving and responsive and don’t worry much about losing their partners’ love.
- Behaviors of a secure person:
	- Be available: respond to the distress of your partner,  and allow them to depend on you when needed.
	- Don't interfere: Provide background support for their goals, allow them to do their own things without trying to take over or control of the situation
	- Encourage: Accept the personal growth goals and help boost their self-esteem.

### Dependency is not a bad thing
We each have an attachment system which are emotions and behaviors we exhibit to make sure that we stay close to our loved ones. This is why babies cry and panic when their parents leave them. This behavior is called protest behavior, and we still exhibit them as adults.

When we get attached, our brain becomes wired to seek support from our partner to regulate our **psychological** and **physiological** well-being.  If our partner fails to meet our emotional needs, we exhibit forms of **protest behavior** until those needs are met.
Only after these needs are met can they become more independent, this is known as the **dependency paradox**

### Pets as a source of inspiration for our romantic relationships
We continue to love our pets despite their many misdemeanors. They destroy our valuables, and demand our attention, but we overlook these negative behaviors and feel positively toward them. Our attitude toward pets are an example of a secure relationship. When our pets do something wrong, we don't assume that are doing it to purposely hurt and we don't hold grudges against them.
