## Psychology of Money


**Don’t study specific people** and focus more on broad patterns. Specific people that dominates the news and media are often extreme examples that are difficult to emulate because the factors that led to their success are extremely complex and include things like luck which you cannot control.
**Find common broad patterns** that can be actually applicable to you and your life.


**Things will not always be well, the opposite is also true things will not always be bad**
You should be skeptical if things are going well, because things will not always continue to go well. Luck can bring you success quickly but risk can make you lose it all just as quickly.
People often underestimate how much they will change in the future. People believe that they have become who they were meant to be for the rest of their lives. It difficult for people to accept that things will change.
This applies to the markets, when things are good people thing it will still good forever and when things are bad people think it will always be bad.

[[Loss Aversion]]
Loses weight heavier on us than gains. When a market goes up people hardly notice, however even if the market goes down a little it is all over the news.

There is no ceiling to social comparison, all you can do is accept that where will always be people better than you.
You must learn to accept that what you have is enough even if it is less than those around you. The key to avoiding social comparison is instead comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to your past self. You are see and feel a difference between your current self and past self you are making progress.

**Time + Compound Interest is the key to building wealth**
Warren buffet accumulated 99% of his total income after the age of 50. The reason he was so successful was because he has continued has been investing for 75 years.
Compounding only works if you give it enough time. You must survive long enough where you can still play the money game. Avoid losing everything at all costs.
The odds of making money:
- Day to day: 50%
- Year to Year: 68%
- 10 years: 88%
- 20 years 100%

**Keeping money vs making money**
Keeping money requires saving and fear that you can lose everything just as fast as you gained it whereas making money requires risk and being optimistic about the future. These two are different skills. However they work together making money requires saving money.

**When to Take Risk**
It is foolish to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.
It doesn’t make sense to risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you.

**Happiness**
[[Freedom and flexility over one’s life is the best predictor of wellbeing]]


**Paradox of being admired and liked**
When you see someone driving a cool car or wearing a cool watch subconsciously most people don’t think “Wow that person looks cools with that car”, we think “Wow other people will think I will look cool if i had that car”

The paradox here is that people want wealth so that they in be admired by others however in reality the other people skip the admiring and just use your wealth as a benchmark for what they need to be admired and like.


**The Underrated key to wealth is savings**
The most effective way to increase your savings is to learn to be happy with less money.
People with high incomes usually don’t care what others think about them. People who desire care less about what others think of them.
Savings gives you flexibility, if gives you the time to wait for good opportunities.

**Investment effort and Investment results**
[[There is little correlation between investment effort and investment results.]]


For example half of warren buffet’s portfolio is just Apple. Just one company is driving the majority of the returns of his entire portfolio.
In investing you don’t want the most efficient strategy instead you want the strategy that maximizes how well you sleep at night. Don’t trade a night’s sleep with some extra profits.
Keep things simple, put all your net worth in a house, checking account and vanguard index funds.

Good decisions are not always rational, sometimes you have to choose between being happy or being “right”.
