## Range

### Chess
There is a saying that “chess is 99 percent tactics.” Tactics are short combinations of moves that players use to get an immediate advantage on the board. When players study all those patterns, they are mastering tactics. Bigger-picture planning in chess—how to manage the little battles to win the war—is called strategy. As Susan Polgar has written, “ you can get a lot further by being very good in tactics”—that is, knowing a lot of patterns—“and have only a basic understanding of strategy


### The Flynn Effect (Why has IQ score increased in the modern age?)
The increase in correct IQ test answers with each new generation in the twentieth century.
This was found through Raven's Progressive Matrices  which are essentially similarity tests. These tests test abstract thinking and your ability to problem solve and see patterns.

**Raven's Progressive Matrices** (often referred to simply as **Raven's Matrices**) or **RPM** is a non-verbal test typically used to measure general human intelligence and **abstract** reasoning and is regarded as a non-verbal estimate of [fluid intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence "Fluid and crystallized intelligence")  It is one of the most common tests administered to both groups and individuals ranging from 5-year-olds to the elderly. It comprises 60 [multiple choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_choice "Multiple choice") questions, listed in order of increasing difficulty. This format is designed to measure the test taker's reasoning ability, the eductive ("[meaning-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning-making "Meaning-making")") component of [Spearman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spearman "Charles Spearman") _**g**_ (_**g**_ is often referred to as [general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics) "G factor (psychometrics)")).

#### Programers and RPC
Programmers do well on raven's because they very good at abstract reasoning. Programmers often use abstraction to simplify complex systems by focusing on thee essential aspects and hiding unnecessary details. One common example of this is functions or methods. These functions and methods take in parameters and produce an output. In some cases it is not entirely necessary to understand how this functions works and it is better to simplify it understand the bigger picture of where this function is being used. 

 RPM test the ability to work out guiding principles when given facts or materials, even in the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before.

The huge Raven’s gains show that today’s children are far better at solving problems on the spot without a previously learned method for doing so.

### Classifications and learning 
In Flynn’s terms, we now see the world through “scientific spectacles.”
He means that rather than relying on our own direct experiences, we make sense of reality through classification schemes, using layers of abstract concepts to understand how pieces of information relate to one another. 

For example when asked a group of remote villagers to classify silk in an array of hues into groups they were unable to. The refused to group them in contrast young farmers with little modern educations were able to naturally form color groups of lighter and darker shades. 

We have grown up in a world of classification schemes totally foreign to the remote villagers; we classify some animals as mammals, and inside of that class make more detailed connections based on the similarity of their physiology and DNA. This makes us better at abstract thinking because of **our ability to group and ideas together and relate them to each other. This makes unfamiliar ideas easier to understand. The ability to find similarities is what seems to be unrelated,** 

#### Improv and learning
Improv masters learn like babies: dive in and imitate and improvise first, learn the formal rules later. “At the beginning, your mom didn’t give you a book and say, ‘This is a noun, this is a pronoun, this is a dangling participle,’” Cecchini told me. “You acquired the sound first. And then you acquire the grammar later

When improvising the brain **turned off the ability to criticize** itself. It does not try to consciously identify mistakes and correct them. **Similar to how babies learn they dive in and imitate and improvise first and then learn the formal rules later.**
Babies learn language by imitating sounds first and then acquire rules later. I never learned the correct grammar rules for english and chinese as a child I was just naturally able to pick then up. 

In all areas breadth training predict breadth transfer. The learner is able to able to apply different contexts to **solve problems you have never seen before.** This is creativity.

#### Learning and Practice
**Generation Effect**, struggling to generate answers even if it is the wrong one helps you learn. Students sacrifice  current performance for future benefit.
**Hypercorrection Effect**, the more confident the student is about their wrong answer the better they are able to remember it when the correct answer is learned.

[[Active Recall]]
Struggling to retrieve information helps the brain learn and remember better **even if the retrieval is unsuccessful or incorrect**. The process of strengthing the ability to search and find that information helps people remember better. 
#### Spaced Repetition
It is important to space out your retrieval, want longer and longer before reviewing the same material again.
Frustration is a sign that you are learning.

#### Interleaved Practice
[What is interleaving, and why does it work?](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/why-interleaving-works)
Mixing up different topics instead of just focusing on one for hours at a time. Interleaving improves student learning by requiring them retrieve previous learned information and see how it links across multiple topics.

Mixed practice is faster for learning, for example when pianists practice jumps across 15 keys, students who practiced only 15 key jumps less accurate than pianists who practiced a variation of key jumps from 8, 12, 15 and 22 key jumps.


### Analogies

Analogies help use take new concepts and make them feel familiar. Analogies and making relations is difficult for other species. Deep analogical thinking allows use to see similarities across multiple. domains that seem to have little in common.  ^fd7a4e

> Concepts from biology serve as analogies to inform the cutting edge of artificial intelligence: “neural networks” that learn how to identify images from examples (when you search cat pictures, for instance) were conceived as akin to the neurons of the brain, and “genetic algorithms” are conceptually based on evolution by natural selection—solutions are tried, evaluated, and the more successful solutions pass on properties to the next round of solutions, ad infinitum.

### Artists
Artists often start just my experimenting what doing what they liked while working other jobs. Most artists don't begin making their art until after retirement.
Just continue learning to draw and practice the songs you like on the piano after work, over time you will develop these skills and this will pay off significantly in the long run when you retire and have time to create the art you actually want. 

Researched found the high-repetition workload negatveily impacted comic art performance. The main factor was the number of different genre the creator has wored worked in, comics who worked on projects from a wide range of genres were better artists and more creative and innovative, sci-fi, crime, fantasy, comedy.
Create art from all genres
	- Ghlibli styled art, color ful
	- Pixar 
	- Technical, Science Fiction Art
For example throughout Hayao Miyazaki career his films range from fantasy, action adventure, sci fi and fairy tales.
	Kiki Delivery Service- coming of age story, slice of life, fantasy
	 Howl's Moving Castle- Sci-fi adventure
	 Secret Life of Ariety- Fairy tale
	 Castle in the Sky - Sci-fi

### It is never two late to start,
Sviatoslav Richter was one of the greatest pianists of the twentieth century; he started formal lessons at twenty-two.
 Lonnie Holley is a self taught artist who began at 29. When his sister's children died in a fire his family could afford gravestones he learned to carve it himself.
Be kind to yourself, everyone progresses at different rate so don't feel like you are behind, don't compare yourself to others compare your self you a prior version of you. As long as you improved you are on the right track.

Conduct experiments, to figure out what you find interesting and want to learn.
Life is just a an experiment. 

### Career
We should treat career more like dating and not settle down so quickly. Take the time early in your career to try and learn things about your selves. 
Researchers found that in professionals who switched their careers often lost a good fraction of their skills but had higher growth rates after switching. Everything is related and skills you learned before will aways come into use down the line even you change careers.
"Winners" quit fast when they detect the plan is not the best it for them. 
"Failure" is when you stick with a career and you don't have the courage to quit. 


### Summary 
How do we learn and become smarter, by categorizing and relating concepts that seem unrelated to each other. We have the ability to make analogies with make new ideas feel familiar and help hu learn them faster
Tips when learning something
- Active Recall
	- Generation effect- the act of retrieving information and generating the solution even if it is wrong benefits the student
	- Hypercorrective effect- the more confident the student is at the wrong answer they generate more likely they are able to remember the solution once they learn.
- Interleaved Practice
	- Instead of focusing on topic for a large block, alternate between different topics, this allows to easily connect different ideas across multiple topics instead of getting to focused on one. It makes more flexible and learn faster.
- Classify things in to groups and related new ideas to old ones.
	- [[Zettlekastan]] It mimics how our brain naturally works to learn, we want to classify things that are similar and relate to each other. [[The Idea Compass]] is a method you can use to think about how to relate different ideas
- Analogies are effective in learning because they help make new ideas feel familiar
- Be kind to yourself and remember it is never too late to start.
