## Framework Thinking

### Structure information
Our brain categorizes information based on these types

1. **Visual** (things that look the same)
    things that are red

2. **Functional** (things that work in the same way)
    transportation

3. **Conceptual** for a particular situation
    things you need in hawaii


Actively Identify Frameworks that exist in the world
1. Organize and structure information
2. Actively map concepts to specific situations
