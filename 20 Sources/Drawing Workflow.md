## Drawing Workflow

The two daily routines I find important professionally I call "300 drawings" and "Daily Edit".
Find cool art you want to recreate (ghibli) goal only draw things you enjoy.



1. **300 Drawings Process:**
   - **Step 1:** Choose a specific subject to improve drawing skills on (e.g., hands, trees, cars).
   - **Step 2:** Develop or find step-by-step methods/recipes/systems for quickly sketching your chosen subject.
   - **Step 3:** Draw 300 quick sketches from imagination using the identified methods, refining these methods throughout the process. This becomes a daily routine over several weeks to improve on the chosen subject.

2. **Daily Edit Process:**
   - **Step 1:** Regularly add drawings to a sketchbook.
   - **Step 2:** Open the sketchbook daily to review and edit drawings by erasing and changing parts that don't feel right.
   - **Step 3:** Continue this process to develop more thought-out and unique sketches, turning the sketchbook into an experimental outlet despite potentially losing its journalistic qualities.
