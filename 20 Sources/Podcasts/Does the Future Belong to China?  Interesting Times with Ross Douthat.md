**What is the difference between [[china]] and the [[United States]]?**
- Shanghai which is the equivalent of New York, the infrastructure is well designed. In additional China has expanded and built into the country side, whereas the US has neglected the middle and focused on building on the coasts.
- China is constantly build while the US is not.
**What is the reason for this? Why does china build and the US doesn’t?**
"[[china]] builds and the U.S. doesn't. And one of your arguments is that this reflects a fundamental difference in our elites and who rules our respective societies.”
- **Difference in the elites who rule our society**
- [[China is ruled by engineers and America is a society of lawyers]]. Chine is an engineering state building it ways out of every problem whereas the U.S. is a lawyerly society which is really good at stopping a lot of things. This means the U.S. does not have much functional infrastructure almost anywhere, but it also does not have these dumb ideas like the [[one-child policy]]
	- **XiPing took over Mao he believed that China needed a highly efficient technocracy so he promoted all the technocrats at the time to the highest ranks of the communist party.** By 2002 all the 9 members of the Communist [[Politburo]] had degrees in engineering. China redirected talent to focus on strategic industries like semiconductors and aviation instead of consumer tech, cryptocurrencies and hedge funds.
	- The Founding documents of the [[Declarations of Independence]] is like a legal argument, all the founding fathers were lawyers. In the [[United States]] it is within our culture to just sue people because we don’t like them.
**what makes china so successful?**
- Even within a communist society there can be [[capitalist]] competition, due the the scale of the country.
- Meituan was an online platform company in China that essentially cloned Groupon. They were the only company that survived after being one of the 5,000 clone of Groupon in china. Because of the amount of competition entrepreneurs are constantly trying to beat each other in the battle royale leading people to work extremely hard to survive because the competition is so fierce.
- In this system the state wins and the consumer wins but it is rough for these companies. 
- This competition created success for the government and consumers get to use these new discovers at the cost of 4,999 failed companies. 
- **But then why would anyone want to start a company then if the odds are stacked so much against them?**
	- I think in Chinese culture, people are more willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. The society is structured around collectivism instead of individualism.
**is free speech and free thinking required to drive a lot of innovations**
- He argues that it is not that important at, many autocratic regimes, actually created a lot of innovations
