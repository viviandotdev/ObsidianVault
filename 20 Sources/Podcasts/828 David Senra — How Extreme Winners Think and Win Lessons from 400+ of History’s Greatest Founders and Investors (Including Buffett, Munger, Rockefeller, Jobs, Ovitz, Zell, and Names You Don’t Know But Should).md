**Design a Great Day**
- David Senra admits to not being a long-term planner, relying on intuition rather than analysis.
- **Senra only plans 24 hours ahead, focusing on designing enjoyable days** and believing **humans don't truly grasp longer time spans**.
	- It is very hard for us to understand 5 year or 10 year time span, you cannot really plan for that long.
	- All you can do is plan tomorrow and that should be enough. Do the best you can to make tomorrow a good day

- Design your day to include activities you enjoy, like health, reading, creating, and spending time with loved ones.
	- I like to get up and do the work
	- I don't like taking vacations and I don't like going to fancy events. 
	- I like to to work, I like to write, I like to read, I like to climb, I like to draw and I like to code
	- I just try to make a great day.

- **Focus on making each day great, as a great life is a string of great days.**
