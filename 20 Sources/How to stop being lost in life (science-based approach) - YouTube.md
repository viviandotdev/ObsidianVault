#### Highlights

Cultivating related ness

What would I want to exist even if I didn’t
The belief that is juice is worth the squeeze is not a result of the juice it is that 
The juice is the result of the belief that it is worth the squeeze.
If you don’t believe the juice is worth squeezing then you would never squeeze and you would never get the juice
The belief that life is worth living is not the result is a good life
You have to believe that life is worth living before you have any proof.

Value what the worlds does to you
- experiences and the pleasures of life
- Feelings, money success life
- Not the goal
Value what you do to the world
- self determination theory, 
- Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
- The value of the thing is the reward of the thing is itself
- Our generation is mostly extrinsicly motivations it is unfullfiling  and makes you bad at it

Intrinsic
- autonomy
    - You are doing it because you want to
- Competence
    - You are good at or getting better at it
- Relatedness
    - There is need for it in the world, being relevant for something bigger than yourself


Arranged marriages have more satisfied 
Pick some thing and 
Something you are interested in
You are good at it
It will provide value

Choose a really small habit for the thing you are doing
Build that habit over time adding more things


Different aims you experience a different reality
What you’ll I want to exist even if you don’t, filter you consciously experience based on what is relearn to you
