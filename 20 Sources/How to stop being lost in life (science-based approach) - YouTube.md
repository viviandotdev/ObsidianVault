#### Highlights

What would I want to exist even if I didnâ€™t
The belief that is juice is worth the squeeze is not a result of the juice it is that 
The juice is the result of the belief that it is worth the squeeze.
If you donâ€™t believe the juice is worth squeezing then you would never squeeze and you would never get the juice
The belief that life is worth living is not the result is a good life
You have to believe that life is worth living before you have any proof.

Value what the worlds does to you
- experiences and the pleasures of life
- Feelings, money success life
- Not the goal
Value what you do to the world
- self determination theory, 
- Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
- The value of the thing is the reward of the thing is itself
- Our generation is mostly extrinsicly motivations it is unfullfiling  and makes you bad at it

Intrinsic
- autonomy
    - You are doing it because you want to
- Competence
    - You are good at or getting better at it
- Relatedness
    - There is need for it in the world, being relevant for something bigger than yourself
		Cultivating related ness

Arranged marriages have higher satisfaction rates than love marriages
- by simply commiting to that person for a long period of time can bring satisfaction
Pick some thing and 
Something you are interested in
You are good at it
It will provide value

Choose a really small habit for the thing you are doing
Build that habit over time adding more things


Different aims you experience a different reality
What youâ€™ll I want to exist even if you donâ€™t, filter you consciously experience based on what is relearn to you
