## How to be more agentic?

Having agency means that you feel that you have **control** and are **responsible** for your own life.

Many people in this world don't have agency, they often play the victim and say that because of their circumstances there is nothing that they can do to change their current situation.

**What are the is the mindset of someone who is agentic?**

The mindset of someone with agency is that they think **anything is learnable.**
For example, if you want to learn to be more charismatic, read some books about and then watch hours of videos of people be charismatic and then practice by trying to emulate them in different scenarios.
You can apply this idea to learning anything. Of course there are people who are better at picking up certain skills than others but the brain is capable of learning anything as long as you give it enough time.

They also **Learn to love being bad at something,** when learning new skills you will have a period of time where you are bad at it, you need to splash around at make failures so you can quickly get feedback and learn from them.

**They are willing to seek feedback and receive criticism**
