For me, the practice of writing and revising notes is, at its core, about trying to move up the following rough ladder:

**Fleeting notes**
**Prompt notes** 
**Evergreen notes**

Prompts and incomplete notes in writing inbox, which are meant to possibly become Evergreen notes. These prompts may accumulate writing over time via spaced repetition.

Evergreen notes, in increasingly complex stages of development:
- stubs implicitly defined through backlinks
- simple definitions for terms of art
- Bridge notes narrowly relate two adjacent terms  
- precise, narrow declarative notes
- higher-level APIs
- notes abstracting over many other notes
- personal terms of art

Don't over-obsess or over-formalize this stuff. Remember: "Better note-taking" misses the point; what matters is "better thinking".
