**Summary**
- When your vault has too many notes it can become a burden to maintain, it feels like you brain is a mess and feel disorganized. 
- Maintaining a vault feels like I spend more time organizing instead of thinking.
- Don't capture everything, only capture things that you will use and ideas that  resonate with you.
- Delete notes often and keep your vault clean, remove outdated ideas, do not feel tied to your ideas, important ideas will always come back to you and will you find it again..
- Life is like a spiral if you miss an opportunity it will always back to you eventually.

**High lights**

**A dusty collection of old selves, old interests, old compulsions, piled on top of each other like geological strata.** Instead of accelerating my thinking, it began to replace it. Instead of aiding memory, it froze my curiosity into static categories.

**PKM systems promise coherence, but they often deliver a kind of abstracted confusion.** The more I wrote into my vault, the less I felt. A quote would spark an insight, I'd clip it, tag it, link it - and move on. But the insight was never lived. It was stored.

**Worse, the architecture began to shape my attention. I started reading to extract. Listening to summarize. Thinking in formats I could file.** Every experience became fodder. I stopped wondering and started processing.

**We do not think in folders. We do not retrieve meaning through backlinks. Our minds are improvisational. They forget on purpose.**

**In trying to remember everything, I outsourced the act of reflection.** I didn't revisit ideas. I didn't interrogate them. I filed them away and trusted the structure. But a structure is not thinking. A tag is not an insight.

**Eventually, I realized I had created a new problem: deferral.** The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold.

**I write knowing it may disappear. I highlight books knowing the highlights will fade. I trust that what matters will return, will find its way to the surface. 

==**I no longer worship the permanence of text.**==

**My new system is, simply, no system at all.** ==I write what I think. I delete what I don't need. I don't capture everything. I don't try to. I read what I feel like. I think in conversation, in movement, in context. I don't build a second brain. I inhabit the first.==

==**I don't want to manage knowledge. I want to live it.**==
