## Idea types 
My newsletters follow a **Problem → Insight → Solution** structure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfr6zcd2c1gzsq3afg57pjnm))
#### WHAT (Start the section with 2-3 of these):
This addresses what you'll talk about—either the problem or the insight. You know what each section needs to accomplish (from your outline).

- Pain points
- Big ideas
- Quotes
- Personal experiences
- Harsh truths
- Curiosity gaps
- Counterintuitive truths

#### HOW (Support your key points with these):
This explains how to understand your point. You cycle through idea types to figure out how to accomplish it.

**Ask yourself:**
- How can I explain this to the reader?
- How severe is the problem?
- How does this insight work?
- How do they implement the solution?

**Use these idea types:**
- Insights
- Curiosity gaps
- Pattern interrupts
- Explanations
- Anecdotes
- Actionable steps
- Metaphors
- Frameworks
- Questions
- Pain points (again)
- Quotes (again)
- Personal experiences (again)

#### WHY (End the section with 2-3 of the same ideas from WHAT):
This explains why this key point solves the problem or reveals something important in relation to the big picture. You end by explaining why it matters to the bigger problem.
