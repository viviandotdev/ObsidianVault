**Goals vs. Constraints:**
- **Goals are a winning condition.** They focus on the end result ("becoming a best-selling author").
- **Constraints are the rules of the game.** They focus on the process and the present moment ("write every day, never write what bores me").
- **Stop trying to "win" the game and start focusing on playing it well.**

**Constraints force a different kind of thinking.** A fixed goal makes you think, "How do I get there?" A self-imposed constraint makes you think, "What is possible from here, given these rules?"

This approach is inherently **adaptive** and allows for creativity to emerge within a defined structure.

**Invisible constraints are what truly matter.** These are the rules you set for yourself that guide your daily actions, not the external targets you hope to hit.

**Constraint-Oriented Approach:**
- **Constraint:** Write every day, and never write what bores you.
- This focuses on sustainable, creative actions within your control. Success becomes a byproduct of consistently following the rules you've set for yourself.
