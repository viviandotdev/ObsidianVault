[[Existentialism]] - individuals create their own meaning and purpose in life without pre-determined meaning.
Your decisions create your life.

This is different from the view that you are born with a purpose?

Success is being able to spend your life in the way you want.
Your life is just a string of consecutive days. We live 24 hours at a time. So all I have to do it design a day that I really enjoy.
I like to get up and do the work
I don't like taking vacations and I don't like going to fancy events. 
I like to to work, I like to write, I like to read, I like to climb, I like to draw and I like to code
I just try to make a great day.
