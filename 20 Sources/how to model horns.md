#### Step 1: Creating the Torus
- **Create a torus:** Begin by creating a torus shape in your 3D modeling software.
- **Shade the torus smoothly:** Apply a smooth shading to the torus to enhance its appearance.
- **Rotate the torus vertically:** Adjust the orientation of the torus so that it is vertical.
- **Duplicate the torus:** Make two more copies of the original torus.
- **Rotate the duplicates:** Position the duplicated tori by rotating them into the desired arrangement.

#### Step 3: Create the Antlers
- **Create a cube:** Add a cube to your scene.
- **Position and modify the cube:**
  - Place the cube centrally between the tori, which resemble antlers.
  - Add a subdivision surface modifier to the cube to round its edges.
  - Extrude the cube to create a curvature that fits well with the antlers.
- **Mirror the modifications:** Apply a **mirror** **modifier** to replicate the changes on the opposite side of the model.
- **Extrude and adjust the antler parts:**
  - Extrude the necessary parts of the antlers to achieve the desired shape.
  - Rotate these parts to match the curvature and orientation of the antlers.

#### Step 5: Final Adjustments
- **Apply the mirror modifier:** Finalize the mirroring process to cement the symmetry of the model.
- **Alter the left side:** Modify the left side of the model to introduce subtle variations, giving a more natural look.
- **Scale the edge faces:** Select the edge faces of the model and scale them to fine-tune the shape and proportions.
