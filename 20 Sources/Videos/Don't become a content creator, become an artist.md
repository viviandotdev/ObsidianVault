1. Clean up your consumption. 
2. Practice
3. Emulate and steal from the people you respect 
4. Remix your references and create something from that 

**Create a mood / reference board of content you want to create  **
- nothing is original 
- **emulation** page,
- this page should excite you
- this is your museum
