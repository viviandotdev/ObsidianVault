- wipe the pan dry with a paper town before you oil it
- heat up the pan on the stove, make sure they pan is dry before you oil it
- then oil the pan both inside and out side 
- heat the pan with the oil to it's **smoke point (**450 degrees)
	- when the oil reaches the **smoke point** the fat molecules break down and reorganize
		-  [Template:Smoke point of cooking oils - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Smoke_point_of_cooking_oils)
	- they form long polymer chains that bond directly to the metal surface, creating a thin plastic-like coating that's chemically bonded to the pan.
	- the polymerized oil fills in the microscopic pores and rough spots in the metal therefore creating a smooth slippery surface that the food does no stick to.
- let the pan **cool down to the touch**
- you can repeat the process to create multiple seasoning layers, which builds upon the previous creating a smother surface over time


Here's a step-by-step guide to re-seasoning your pan, bolding the key actions and details:

## Re-Seasoning Your Pan: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Strip Existing Seasoning

1.  **Coat the bottom of the pan with vinegar** and **line the sides with vinegar-soaked paper towels**.
2.  **Let it sit for an hour**.
3.  If seasoning remains, **fill the pan (with vinegar still in it) with water and boil it**.
4.  **Scrub off any remaining seasoning** with soap (Bar Keepers Friend is recommended) and a Scotch Brite pad.

### Step 2: Apply the Initial Oil Layer

1.  **Drizzle a small amount (less than a tablespoon)** of **high smoke point oil** (like canola, vegetable, or sesame oil) into the pan. **Avoid olive oil or butter**.
2.  **Rub the oil into the pan with a paper towel**.
3.  **Crucially, take a fresh paper towel and WIPE ALL THE OIL OFF**. The pan should look as if no oil touched it, as the oil should now be in the pan's pores.
4.  **Repeat this oil-coating process for the handle and outside of the pan** to prevent rust.

### Step 3: Heat the Pan (Oven Method)

1.  **Place the pan upside-down in the oven**.
2.  **Heat for one hour at 450Â°F** (this is higher than the oil's smoke point to ensure it burns off).

---

### Step 4: Heat the Pan (Stovetop Method)

1.  **Ensure the heat is no higher than 70%**.
2.  **Heat the pan until it starts to discolor** in one area.
3.  **Reposition the pan around the burner** to heat other less-discolored areas. This part requires a bit of experimentation.
4.  **If the color becomes silver-y or graphite-y, turn the burner off immediately** to avoid over-burning, which can cause chipping. A **blue color is acceptable**.

### Step 5: Build the Foundation

1.  **Repeat the oil-coating and heating process 2-3 times** to create an initial foundation layer of seasoning.
2.  Once complete, you're ready to **start cooking** and watch your seasoning evolve into a beautiful patina!
