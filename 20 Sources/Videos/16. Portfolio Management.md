## Portfolio Management
1. observations
2. models, math
3. observations

3 ->1 Loop
Portfolio Theory has many special cases
Spending and Earning do not match up well
We want to balance it out
expected return of a portfolio
Maximize return and minimize the standard devision
Highest return with lowest standard deviation

Efficient Frontier:
higher return low risk
	**diversification: free lunch**
	**weight more on low volatility assets**
	as you get older you want to weight more on low volatility assets
