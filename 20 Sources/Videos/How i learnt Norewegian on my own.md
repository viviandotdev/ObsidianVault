## How I learnt Norewegian on my own

How do kids learn language?
1. Listen to the language as much as possible
2. Listen to podcasts, cleaning, playing a game, before going to bed
3. **Read things many times.**
	1. Listening to the same book over and over again.
	2. Take the expression from the book and make it your own.
	3. Take a sentence and try to understand everything about it
4. Learn a lot of simple words that you can use all the time and find sentences with them
	1. Find a context of your word and write it down
5. Make a list of the sentences
6. Read the sentences out loud
7. Keep a journal, write your own personal texts like a journal. Use Google Translate
	- write 5 sentences about your day.
8. Buy and read books
9. Read and at the same time read the audiobooks at the same time
10. **Use series and movies**
	watch an episode of the series
	copy and write down the sentences you like
	- watch without subtitles
	- watch with target language subtitles
	- watch with English titles
	- watch again with target language subtitles
	Repeat this for specific scenes not the whole movie at once.
11. Learn sentences and stories by heart
	- She read and listened to the Norwegian story until she knew it by heart, spending 1-2 weeks on a story.
		- To work on listening and writing she would listen to the recording without reading and then try to write all the words that she heard.

12. Speak to yourself in the target language
