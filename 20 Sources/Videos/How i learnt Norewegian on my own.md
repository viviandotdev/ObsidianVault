How do kids learn language?
1. Listen to the language as much as possible
2. Listen to podcasts, cleaning, playing a game, before going to bed
3. **Read things many times.**
	1. Listening to the same book over and over again.
	2. Take the expression from the book and make it your own.
	3. Take a sentence and try to understand everything about it
4. Learn a lot of simple words that you can use all the time and find sentences with them
	1. Find a context of your word and write it down
5. Make a list of the sentences
6. Read the sentences out loud
7. Keep a journal, write your own personal texts like a journal. Use Google Translate
	- write 5 sentences about your day.
8. Buy and read books
9. Read and at the same time read the audiobooks at the same time
10. **Use series and movies**
	watch an episode of the series
