#### Ideas


- [[Intrinsic Motivation]]

## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation

**do you value more what the world does to you or what you do to the world?**
**Value what the worlds does to you** 
- experiences and the pleasures of life
- Feelings, money success life
- Our generation is mostly extrinsically motivations it is unfulfilling  and actually makes you bad at it
**Value what you do to the world** (the better way to think about life)
- self determination theory, 
- The value of the thing is the reward of the thing is itself
- **What would I want to exist even if I didn’t**



Intrinsic Motivations comes from 
- **Autonomy**
    - You are doing it because you want to
- **Competence**
    - You are good at or getting better at it
- **Relatedness**
    - There is need for it in the world, being relevant for something bigger than yourself
		Cultivating related ness
### **Notes**
**What would I want to exist even if I didn’t**
The belief that is juice is worth the squeeze is not a result of the juice it is that 
The juice is the result of the belief that it is worth the squeeze.
If you don’t believe the juice is worth squeezing then you would never squeeze and you would never get the juice
The belief that life is worth living is not the result is a good life
**You have to believe that life is worth living before you have any proof.**

[[Intrinsic Motivation]]


**Commitment and Motivation**
**Intrinsic motivation is the result of commitment rather than passion**
Arranged marriages have higher satisfaction rates than love marriages
- by simply committing to that person for a long period of time can bring satisfaction and build passion for the relationship
Similar for choosing a career, rather than waiting around for something that you are passionate about it is better to pick something and commit to it for long enough where it can bring you satisfaction
Pick some thing and 
Something you are interested in
You are good at it
It will provide value

Choose a really small habit for the thing you are doing
Build that habit over time adding more things


Different aims you experience a different reality
**What you’ll I want to exist even if you don’t, filter you consciously experience based on what is relevant to you**
