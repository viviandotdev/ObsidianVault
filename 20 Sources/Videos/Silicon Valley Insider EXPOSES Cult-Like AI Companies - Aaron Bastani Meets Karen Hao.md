**AI Terminology**
- Karen Hao explains that AI is a suitcase term, encompassing machine learning. 
- **Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning, specifically using neural networks.

<blockquote><b>Karen Hao</b><br/><br/>One of the founding fathers of AI used to call AI a suitcase word because you can put whatever you want in the suitcase and suddenly AI means something different. So we have this suitcase word of AI. And then under that, any data-driven AI techniques are called machine learning. And then any neural network data-driven techniques are called deep learning. So it's the smallest circle within this broader suitcase. So deep learning and neural networks are kind of interchangeable. Not exactly in the sense that neural networks are referring to a piece of software and deep learning is referring to the process that the software is doing.</blockquote>

**Generative AI's Resource Intensity**

- Generative AI models consume extraordinary resources often unnecessarily for tasks achievable by simpler methods.
- Using such intensive tools for trivial tasks is inefficient and environmentally costly.

<blockquote><b>Karen Hao</b><br/><br/>Exactly. Like it's not fit for the task. And the extraordinary amount of environmental costs for flying that rocket when you could have flown a much more efficient plane to do the same thing is like, what are you doing? And that's one of the things that people don't really realize about artificial or about generative AI is that the resource consumption required to develop these models and also use These models is quite extraordinary. And oftentimes people are using them for tasks that could be achieved with highly efficient, different AI techniques. But because we use the sweeping term AI to mean anything, then people just think, oh, yeah, right, right.</blockquote>

### [11:07] AI Data Centers' Environmental Toll

**AI Data Centers' Environmental Toll**

- AI data centers require vast energy and water, often relying on fossil fuels and public drinking water.
- This intensifies climate and public health crises in surrounding communities.
- AI actually requires a lot of clean drinking water to cool down the systems therefore, a lot clean water is being used up in even areas where there is already a limited water supply

<blockquote><b>Karen Hao</b><br/><br/>There are numbers around the energy consumption, which you could then use to kind of try and project carbon emissions. There was a McKinsey report that recently projected that based on the current pace of data center and supercomputer expansion for the development and deployment of AI technologies, We would need to add around half to 1.2 times the amount of energy consumed in the UK annually to the global grid in the next five years. Wow. Yeah. And most of that will be serviced by fossil fuels. This is something that Sam Altman actually even said in front of the Senate a couple of weeks ago. He said it will most probably be natural gas. So he actually picked the nicest fossil fuel. But we're already seeing reports of coal plants having their lives extended. They were meant to be retired, but they're no longer being retired explicitly to power data center development. We're seeing reports of Elon Musk's XAI, the giant supercomputer that he built called Colossus in Memphis, Tennessee. It is being powered with around 35 unlicensed methane gas turbines that are pumping thousands of toxic air pollutants into the air, into that community. So this</blockquote>

**AI Firms Sideline Democracy**

- AI companies often bypass regulations and local laws to expand infrastructure rapidly.
- This tactic undermines democratic processes at all levels of governance.
- AI is all about rebranding
- Open AI
- China vs US approach to AI, quasi religion
- whereas in china these are business we are building tools?

[44:33] **Sam Altman's Leadership**
- Sam Altman understands human psychology well, which helps him recruit talent and persuade resource holders.
- Many people don't know what Sam Altman truly believes, he is known for his 1 on 1's where he will say whatever the person want's to hear to get him on their side.
- Because of this he often says contradictory information to different people. 


"he does his best work in one-on meetings when he can say whatever he needs To say to get you to do, believe, achieve whatever it is that he needs you to do."



 [53:27] **AI's Hidden Environmental Cost**
- Public sustainability reports from Google and Microsoft don't specify AI's environmental impact.
- In 2024, where both Google and Microsoft reported a 30% and 50% jump in their carbon emission despite data massaging.
