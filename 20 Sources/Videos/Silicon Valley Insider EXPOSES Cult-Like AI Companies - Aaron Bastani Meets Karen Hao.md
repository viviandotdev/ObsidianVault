### Top Quotes
- **Technology is a product of human choices**

**AI Terminology**
- Karen Hao explains that AI is a suitcase term, encompassing machine learning.

- **[[Deep learning]]** is a subset of machine learning, specifically **using** multilayerd [[neural networks]].
- A neural network is the underlying technology in deep learning, that is inspired by human brains to process and learn from vast amount of data 



**Generative AI's Resource Intensity**
- Generative AI models consume extraordinary resources often unnecessarily for tasks achievable by simpler methods.
- Using such intensive tools for trivial tasks is inefficient and environmentally costly.

**AI Data Centers' Environmental Toll**

- AI data centers require vast energy and water, often relying on fossil fuels and public drinking water.
- This intensifies climate and public health crises in surrounding communities.
- AI actually requires a lot of clean drinking water to cool down the systems therefore, a lot clean water is being used up in even areas where there is already a limited water supply
