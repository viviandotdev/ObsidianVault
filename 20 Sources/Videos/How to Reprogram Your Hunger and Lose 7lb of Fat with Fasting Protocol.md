## How to Reprogram Your Hunger and Lose 7lb of Fat with Fasting Protocol

**Transform Body Composition and Increase Lifespan with Fasting**

- **Science of Reducing Hunger:** Learn how to decrease overall hunger long-term to burn fat, keep it off, and maintain high mental clarity and energy levels.
- **3 Science-Backed Secrets for Easier Multi-Day Fasting:**
  - **TRT and Ghrelin:** Understand the decrease of the hunger hormone, ghrelin, during fasting. [Study Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15522942/)

**Solution to Post-Weight Loss Hunger:**

- **Hormonal Changes:** Prevent increased hunger after weight loss by staying in ketosis.
- **Ketosis Benefits:** Fasting increases ketones, allowing sustenance on an 800-calorie diet after two weeks. This is the principle behind the keto diet.
  - [Study on Ketosis and Appetite](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23632752/)
- **Upton Sinclair Fasting Protocol:** Hunger disappears for a few days during total fasting but eventually returns.
- If you are worried about losing muscle during fasting, ketones actually help preserve muscle
[Anticatabolic Effects of Ketone Bodies in Skeletal Muscle - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30712977/)
- Doesn't your brain need carbs (surgar/glucose).
	- yes but your brain can also survive off on ketone bodies![[Screenshot 2024-10-27 at 7.49.35 PM.png]]
**Benefits of Fasting:**
- Raises ketones
- Reduces seizures
- Improves depression
- Lowers anxiety, inflammation, pain, and allergies


**Fasting Hormones:**
- BDNF, insulin, ghrelin, growth hormone


Fasting -> Fat Adaption (PPAR(alpha))-> Less Hunger ([[PPAR-alpha]])
Getting the body to use it own body tissue (fat tissue) for energy (fat adapation)
	when you do multiple fasts your bad gets fat adapted can you can

Fasting gets easier
PPAR induces fat adaption leads to less hunger
Fat adaption (more efficiet at burning fat)
Area of fat around mid section, 26% reduction in mid area reduction, fasting gets easier and, the more often you fast the body learns how to turn fat into energy more efficently each time you do it, increase the amount of fat loss in each subsequent fast ![[Screenshot 2024-10-27 at 8.03.21 PM.png]]
Prolonged vs intermittenet fasting
Fat burning reaches a peak at day 5, through the fast the body gets better and better at fat burning until day 5 and then it plateaus
[demonstrated that the increased fat oxidation reached a plateau at 5 d after KD, with no further changes over the remaining 10 d. In the early work by Phinney et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522012217#bib18)

**Historical Insight:**
- **Minnesota Starvation Experiment**
	- Semi starvation -getting food, and ravenous hungry because they were never able to get into ketosis

The main way to make fasting easier is to speed up the process of getting into ketosis

**#1 Start the Fast in Ketosis or as close to ketosis as possible:**
- **Preparation:** Eat a low-carb/keto diet for a week beforehand to ease the fasting process.
- **Carb Tapering:** Gradually reduce carbs over the week.![[Screenshot 2024-10-27 at 8.29.34 PM.png]]
- **Exercise:** Engage in low-intensity steady exercise, like walking, to reduce carbohydrate stores and preserve muscle. Walking helps the fast, I fasted for 5 days and walked 7 hours, was the easiest fast.
	- Plan lectures, audio books and and things to listen to during the walks

**#2 Avoid Fasting Fatigue:**
Common fasting fatigue symptoms are similar to low sodium symptoms, so maybe these symptoms are from sodium loss not hunger. Do not drink to much water, but it will make you flush out more electrolytes which is not what you want.
- **Sodium Loss:** Fasting leads to sodium loss, causing fatigue, nausea, low energy, and muscle weakness.
  - Avoid saunas and excessive water intake, which can flush out electrolytes.
  - Include sodium in your water to prevent fatigue.
  - **Salt Intake:** Higher salt intake (4000 mg = 12 grams) may lower heart disease risk.
- **Electrolyte Balance:** Ensure a balance of magnesium and potassium with sodium.
- **Hot Salty Broth:** A miso soup or hot salty drink can help overcome fasting challenges.
Salt affects hunger
**Secret #3  Increase Energy and Build Lean Muscle**
- **Breaking the Fast:** Avoid watery carbs like watermelon and congee.
- **Refeed on Lean Protein:** Helps **IGF-1** levels rise again.
- - Myostatin -> protein that limits muscle growth in humans and other animals
	-thererfor if you want to gain more muslce reduce myostatin
	- after a prolonged fast your body will reduce myostatin a period of time after refeeding
- **Refeed Protocol:** Follow a feast and fast protocol for optimal results.
