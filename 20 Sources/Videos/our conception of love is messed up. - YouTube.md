passive vs **active love**
	what are the differences?
we are conditioned to believe love is out there waiting for you
you only have one soulmate and they will find you one day
**people make themselves lovable instead of loving**	
- everyone is trying to increase their market value 
however people don't focus on the loving itself, they don't even know how to love, they just care about making themselves lovable
	how do i become loved? (passive) vs how do i love? (active)
people want to be loved ******
love needs to be learned it is any activity
	requires **dedication, faith and effort**
	you should not only love when it is convenient and enjoyable for you
"fall in love"

[[People care more about ways to make themselves more lovable instead of focusing on learning how to love]]
Love should be active not passive, it needs to be learned like an art such as painting or playing an instrument it takes dedication and effort
love is not something that happens to you it is something you build and should full fill you
for example when a artist completes a painting it fulfill them
women are taught that love is something that happens to them, but we also have the power to take action and be able to learn how to love someone

**Personal Experience**-
- i don't think i know how to love, i don't think my parents know how to love either
- whatever my parents have i know what love is not but I don't think i know what love is?

- art of loving by eric
