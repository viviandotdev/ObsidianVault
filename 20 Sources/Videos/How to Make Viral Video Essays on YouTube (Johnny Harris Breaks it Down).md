## 1. Topic Selection (Greenlight Phase)
- Choose a specific topic to focus on
- Commit to exploring it deeply rather than jumping between ideas
- Trust that sustained focus will make the topic interesting

## 2. Initial Documentation
Create a comprehensive document that includes:
- All questions you have about the topic
- Everything you currently know
- What makes this topic interesting
- Everything you want to learn

## 3. Research Phase
- Send the document to a researcher
- Researcher produces 60-80 pages of material that answers your questions
- This provides a deep foundation of information

## 4. Processing & Outlining
- Review and process the research materials
- Curate an outline that shapes the narrative
- Develop the story structure

## 5. Creative Writing (3-4 Day Block)
- Dedicate 3-4 consecutive days to writing
- Use the time constraint (urgency) to sharpen focus
- Transform chaotic information into a clear, linear presentation
- Find the satisfying explanation that ties everything together
- Focus on visual storytelling throughout

## The System
**Writing Schedule:**
- 9am - 2pm dedicated writing blocks
- 3-4 days per week
- Each day focuses on hitting specific topic milestones
- Follow the system consistently without deviation

**Core Philosophy:**
Stick with ideas long enough for them to become interesting rather than jumping around to find what seems immediately compelling.
