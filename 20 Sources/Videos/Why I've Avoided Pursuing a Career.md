### Summary
***She never pursued a career and feels happier for it***
She felt very behind her classmates as senior in college and did not know what to do with her life.
A mentor helps her find a job in corporate marketing
After getting the job she feels immense anxiety and experiences an panic attack, therefore she declines the offer
She is 50 years old and believes she has lived an interesting life, but it is not successful by the standards of society,(what is conventional)

She is not rich and does not have a house
But these are the trade offs she chose to make by following her [[curiosity]] instead of building a career
When you buy a house you become chained to a mortgage and therefore that mortgage will **chain you to a job** 
She was able to travel to multiple countries and try multiple different jobs
She felt more freedom, to change and grow and chasing a career will not allow her to do that.
