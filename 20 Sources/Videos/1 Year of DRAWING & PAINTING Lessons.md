- Self Taught is not efficient
    - expect mistakes,
    - no one to tell you what is efficient
    - no feedback
    - lack big picture, just acquiring things
    - a master will be able to tell you what you doing wrong, gives you reliable feedback
    - take all the courses you can, study from everyone
    - realizing that doing things out of sequence
        - need to figure out the sequence you need to learn things

- nma (glenn vilppu and steve huston)
    - drawing and painting are fused
    - seeing someone doing something you though was impossible
    - drawing, studying of form, paying very close to attention to how things are formed and appreciate the study of life and things
    - drawing take time to study something and apply to something else later on
    - the process of drawing is much faster than you think
    - **need drawing skills before doing 3D, allows you navigate 3D space on a 2D page**
    - 10,000 drawings
        - drawing is practice not precious, just continue to draw
    - think about bigger forms, do not get stuck into the details
    - started with figure drawing
    - spend more time on your work and you may be better than you think
