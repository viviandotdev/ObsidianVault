**Common Problems**
- Common issues is that people spend more time organizing their system rather than actually using it
- For example a complex notion dashboard takes more time to maintain than to actually use to progress on your goals
- The people who sell you these templates profit off of making these templates, it is their job to create these templates, but we don't know if they actually use these templates and helped them be successful.]
- Doing this is just another for a procrastination, that feel productive but really you are not actually doing anything 
**Personal Experience**
- you are over complicating your productivity organization system
- you might be spending more time organizing your system then actually using 
- i feel that with using obsidian i have spend more time thinking about how to organize my system then actually using the system 

**Potential Framework, System, or Solution**
- I will use a very **simple system for obsidian for creating notes and reviewing them**
- I will **stop trying to overcomplicate my system** 
- My **notes app is where I will keep all my fleeting notes** and ideas that are coming in and put. them into and organize later obsidian 
- He does not use an app like obisidan you uses an AI tool that auto categorizes his notes and makes them easy to find.
- Most things you should be able to find with a fuzzy search in obsidan
- You should bias towards getting the thing done and using the info instead of figuring out how to organize it.
- For example when I needed a screenshot I was paralyzed because i didn't know where to put it or save it.
- That extra overhead paralyzed me and my ability to move on so i felt stuck
- Your system should be a little disorganized
