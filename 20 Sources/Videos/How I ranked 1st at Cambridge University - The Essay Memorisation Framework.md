This framework was instrumental in achieving top exam results, including winning a prestigious prize at Cambridge University. This framework can be used to applied to learn many other things as well. Especially understanding a lot of content and information and being able to reproduce it in a structured way.

### 1 . Creation Stage
The foundation of strong essay plans lies in thorough research and effective content generation.

* **Google Search:** The primary tool for finding information, with a focus on review articles and academic papers.
* **Research Document Creation:** Relevant information is rephrased in the author's own words to create a personalized research document.

Even with well-structured plans, effective memorization is key to success.
* **Anki Flashcards:** Every paragraph within each essay plan is converted into Anki flashcards for detailed memorization. While seemingly extensive, this method proved highly effective.
* **Spider Diagrams:** These visual tools are used to memorize entire essays, providing a clear representation of the content's structure and interconnections.

### 3. Revision Stage
A systematic revision approach ensures that memorized information is retained and readily accessible.
