**Summary Note**
[[Temporal Landmarks]]
Important dates / times that differentiates your current from your past self.
Identify the temporal landmarks in your day
when you shift from a task to another, or from a date to another

**My Temporal Landmarks**
	6:00am wake up
	9:00am work starts (reboot)
	5:00pm work ends
	9:00pm bed

**Why does this work**
Setting alarms at these times allow starting fresh with a day and make sure you're on track. They also can be **automatic reminders that make sure that you are on track and on the right path.**
- The alarms you set decreases [[cognitive load]], decreases the amount of information you need to hold in your brain, this allows you to pay more attention to the task at hand

The one constant habit that you do that makes you feel most fulfilled.
(start journaling to really find your domino habit)
- exercise?
- Wake up immediately into a flow session


With multiple [[Temporal Landmarks]] you will have multiple chances in your day to do your [[Domino Habit]] which will help autocorrect your day, if you miss it
