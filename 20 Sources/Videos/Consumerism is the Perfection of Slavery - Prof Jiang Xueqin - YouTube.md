Marx was right in that communism would happen first in the US and Europe because it was more industrialized than China or the Soviet Union

### Worker 1950s-1970s
After World Word 2 western societies adopted some of the ideas of [[communism]]
In communism, **worker is the heart** and center of society because **workers create values**. World War II was devastating so to restart we needed a system that created value.
- Workers have a good job
- Excellent health care
- Cheap universities 
During this period **CEOs** made 1 millions dollars which was on **20x the average worker**

### Revolt of the Elite 80's 
In the 80â€™s  the Reagan revolution, created free market capitalism, started by the **elite**, This began the transition from **workers to consumers**.
**The Elite do not want equality, they was difference**. The want power and money
 In [[capitalism]] **money is the heart and center** of society however money does not create value in the same way workers do, money is speculative.  **We transition to the consumer as the organizing unit.**
 - consumers get low prices
 - consumers get wide selection of goods 

**Consumerism is what fuels [[capitalism]]** 
Consumerism economic logic
- [[consumerism]] create competition for prestige
	- - we are taught go to school -> get job -> make money -> to buy things -> then post on social media to show everyone the things you bought 
	- Everyone goes into debt and we start to hate each other
- create individualism and optimization of you
- see the world through the lens of capital, when you see some one you don't of if you like them you think how much money they make

Today **CEOs** make on average 200 million dollars with is about **200x the salary of an average worker**


**Perfection of slavery**
As a consumer you don't know you are being a slave, you like this so you don't rebel
whereas if you are a slave you will actually rebel
We achieve what the elites want while the masses are unable to rebel
