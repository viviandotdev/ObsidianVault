2025 Founder Recap: State of Sublime

- Playing the infinite game
	- the purpose of the game is to continue playing, whereas in finite games the purpose of the game is to win.
> Previously I was thinking about ways to play the finite game, I wanted to build a product that made a lot of money so that I could win. That is not the way you should approach building, you should build something because you want it to exist and contribute to making it exist.
	- companies approached Mark to buy facebook but he always declined because he thought what else would he do? Facebook was his and it was was he wanted to work on and grow.

- However, her perspective for building sublime adopt the **exist strategy**, "==to get to a place where sublime could exist indefinitely==.” She wants to build something that could last forever
	- there is no [[exit strategy]], she adopts an exists strategy
		- this is the opposite of how most start-ups operate, most start-ups have an exit strategy they wanted to be eventually bought out by one of the big tech companies so that they can cash out.
- She prefer slow, sustained growth in contrast to fast paced growth.
	- For example companies like Cluely who attracts large audience through controversial rage bait marketing, struggle with low conversion rates
