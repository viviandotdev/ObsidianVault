- input -> outputs
- you can only cook what's in the fridge
- you can only create from what you know
- how to do get more ideas and information through reading
- **you can only think things that you were introduced to**
- limiting vocabulary we a way to control people, so they cannot express how they feel
- **read more books so you have more ideas to express your self**
- garbage in == garbage out
- the more creative things you surround your stuff the more things you are able to output
- if you surround yourself with cool and interesting ideas you are able to remix them better
