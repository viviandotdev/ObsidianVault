Chooses to see the flaws or the bad sides similar to Vicky, like i feel like they choose too find your faults instead of seeing the good parts about the person. for example i like to assume all people are good until their actions prove me otherwise.




**Made me feel bad**
**Do you even like hanging out with me or just find me annoying most of the time?**
- I felt like I did something to annoy you during Mikado.
- I felt you were mean to me. Maybe it was because I was on my period, and I was overthinking, but it felt like you hated me sometimes.
- Was it because I was late? Or when I asked about the happy hour thing? I was just curious if we could, and if not, no big deal.
- Then you whispered to Sandy about something.
- Did I do something to annoy you during Mikado, Tuesday?
- I get the same feeling with my sister. I feel like being myself annoys you, so I shut up and pretend I'm invisible to avoid annoying you.
- The difference is you make me happier than anxious, so I'll hang out with you because there's a higher chance I'll have fun, but there's still that feeling.
- I'm sure you don't like feeling annoyed at me either, but I'm just being me. Should I not be myself? Do you want me to be who you want me to be or do what you want me to do?
- I hate it when people assume my intentions, but I think they do because I don't communicate clearly.
- I feel a little uncomfortable psychologically when she always lets me pay for everything, then she also expects me to buy her a computer.
- Makes me feel bad for certain things, like for example when I did not buy the game she said she wanted us to buy


**Made me feel good**
- When we climb together I have a lot of fun.
- Many similar interests and we have a lot of fun when we hang out together.
- Is always excited about has positive energy that is comforting
- Super easy to talk to and have a conversation with sometimes.
