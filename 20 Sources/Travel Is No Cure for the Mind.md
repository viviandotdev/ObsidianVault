The Box of Daily Experience, is are the mundane everyday tasks that make up our life.

We think that with travel we can escape our repetitive lives and experience new and exciting things.

The Box is your mind, our mind is constant and will always be there where we go. If your mind is not at ease it will follow you wherever you travel.

"We tend to grossly overestimate the pleasure brought forth by new experiences and underestimate the power of finding meaning in current ones."

"To strengthen the health of the mind, the venue to do that in is the one we are in now.It is location-independent, and always will be."

One way we can fill  our desire for new experiences and through books. Books allow us to access the minds of amazing people and absorb their life experiences in just a few weeks.
