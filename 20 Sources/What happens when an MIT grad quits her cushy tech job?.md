# What happens when an MIT grad quits her cushy tech job?


### Summary

**what it was like working at a start up as a product designer**
She felt miserable working her corporate job where she felt like she was dying
	- Working at a start up the founders are very anxious and trickles down the employees
	- It makes sense, working at a start up, you are just trying to survive and do everything you can to make your investors happy.
	- This create a very high pressure environment where you can feel like you are being micro- managed
	- Especially young and female, designers they are often looked down upon and everyone is trying to tell them how to do their job 

**Working at a company feels performative** where instead of making something you believe is valuable you are making something that looks valuable to the investors
	Designing not the for the user but for the investor,

**why she left her role?**
Her values did not align with the values of working for a company
"Creating is an act of love" for her and it felt wrong to be making something that she didn't even believe in
She **deeply values creative freedom** and working at a company contradicts that value which is what lead to her being so unhappy 

However not everyone values creative freedom in the same way she does which is why some people are able to put up with the corporate life style to fund their vacations so that they could make memories with their friends and family [[creativity]]

She realizes she does not really care for vacations, they are actually kind of stressful for her

Money will buy her happiness
Money is not free
It is transactional exchange
If you give up too much of yourself, you will feel less
