### The only thing that stopped me from infinite scrolling

There are five things that I now do, simply by using a pen which have  stopped me from infinite scrolling and banished my crippling internet and social media addiction. 

There is also one thing I now do with a pen and paper that I credit with completely overhauling my diet and changing everything that I eat. I wanted to share all of this with you in the hope that you find it useful. 

If you are interested in trying out any of the things I talk about in this video, then start small. If you start with habit tracking, don&#39;t try and track too many new habits as this will inevitably lead to failure. As with anything new, try and develop the habit in a very small way and nurture it from there.

I started doing all of these exercises using pen and paper, but I now use the Remarkable Paper Pro. This tool has really helped organise all of my documents, ideas and journaling. However, you absolutely do not need this to do any of the things I talk about in this video.

Outline:

00:00 The habit tracker and mood checker
00:18 Notice the cues
01:12 What gets measured gets managed
01:38 Set up guide
03:17 Don&#39;t break the chain
04:29 Change what you eat
06:21 Storyworthy
07:29 As Many Wins As Possible
08:37 3 key tasks
09:46 Acknowlegements

Thank you for watching!
