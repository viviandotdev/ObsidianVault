### The Many Worlds of Enough - More To That

Enough is elusive (difficult to reach) because when you reach it, you're no longer the person that once desired it.


Salaries and money are byproducts of ambition not because they were your primary desire.
If your primary desire is to make as much money as possible that is greed.

On the spiral dynamics chart at stage orange people value efficiency and maximizing profits no matter what this is what capitalism is based off of.


I don't need anymore money I don't need any more things. I already get to wake up everyday, spend my time how I want to if you choose to chase money and things there will never be enough. There will always be more money and things to have, 

Money is infinite we can print more of it and and create it from nothing its just paper.

Don't you think it is weird to say you don't believe in God but you believe in money. We have to believe in money because if we didn't society would collapse.


Overtime ambition can become greed if you don't have the self awareness to correct it.

> Ambition is largely driven by self-actualization, or the desire to become a more capable person. And when this happens, it’s only natural that good outcomes arise. You’ll witness bumps in your reputation, be offered higher salaries, and so on. But these things happen as a byproduct of your ambition, and not because these outcomes were your primary desires.

> Adolf Merckle’s graph looked like shortly before his death, it would resemble the one above. One propelled upward in perpetuity without the self-awareness required to adequately correct it. One where reputation and acclaim defined his entire being, and the lack of it meant that his very survival was in jeopardy.

> “You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.” You have to have your Worlds of Enough extend upward before realizing that this trend needs to be corrected. After all, a minimalist is nothing more than a maximalist recovering from this epiphany.
