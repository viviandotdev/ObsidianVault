### How the US Is Destroying Young Peopleâ€™s Future | Scott Galloway | TED

The youth are making less money for doing the same work as the generation before them.
For example housing prices have sky rocketed compared to ages in our generation, we will not be able to afford homes.

**Affirmative action should be based on the amount of money of your household NOT the color of your skin.**

Wealth is being transferred from the youth to old people who are just sitting on the money. We should be figuring out ways to redistribute this wealth to the youth so that it can be used.

It's not about telling the youth to work harder, that has nothing to do with it, our society is structured in a way where the government is incentivized to make the rich, richer without any method of getting the money back and reattributing it to the poor. The rich don't do anything to get richer, placing your money in the S&P 500 and watching it grow does not mean you are working harder.

### Notes

**Do we love your children?*

In the past few year inflation is growing much faster than wages


And the [[social contract]] is decreasing, the percentage to 30 year olds earning more than their parents is falling

**The youth are making less money doing the same work**

Young people are angry we donâ€™t get the same prosperity as their elders

Home prices are up and out of reach

Wealth is transferred to the elderly

Higher-ed should be about taking unremarkable kids and giving them a chance

Artificially constrain supplyÂ 

College is a hedge fund offering classes
**Affirmative action should be based on income not the color of your skin.**

Capital is growingÂ 
Wages vs wealth, wages have barely moved compared to the S&p500

Social security, is the great transfer from young to old

Old people vote are in charge, the old people in charge will not understand the challenges of the youth.
