### How the US Is Destroying Young Peopleâ€™s Future | Scott Galloway | TED

The youth are making less money for doing the same work as the generation before them. 
For example housing prices have sky rocketed compared to ages in our generation, we will not be able to afford homes.
[[Why have housing pr]]

**Do we love your children?*
  
In the past few year inflation is growing much faster than wages


And the [[social contract]] is decreasing, the percentage to 30 year olds earning more than their parents is falling

**The youth are making less money doing the same work**

  

  

Young people are angry we donâ€™t get the same prosperity as their elders

  

Home prices are up and out of reach

  

  

Wealth is transferred to the elderly

  

  

Higher ed should be about taking unremarkable kids and giving them a chance

Artificially constrain supplyÂ 

  

College is a hedge fund offering classes

Affirmative action should be based on income not the color of your skin.

  

Capital is growingÂ 

Wages vs wealth, wages have barely moved compared to the S&p500

The higher ed should give the opportunity for the unremarkableÂ 

  

Social security, is the great transfer from young to old,

Old people vote are in charge, the old people in charge will not understand the challenges of the youth.
