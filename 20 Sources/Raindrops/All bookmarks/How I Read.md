### How I Read



#### Highlights

> When I encounter a highlight with
&gt;information that I’d like to remember more explicitly, I use Anki’s
&gt;“mark” feature. Periodically, I work through Marked items and convert
&gt;them into fine-grained question-and-answer cards in Anki, then suspend
&gt;the Highlight note.
