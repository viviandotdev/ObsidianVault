### Rory Sutherland â€“ Are We Now Too Impatient to Be Intelligent? | Nudgestock 2024

Rory explains how we weight information that appears quickly over knowledge that really matters.

-- 

Nudgestock is the world&#39;s biggest festival of behavioural science and creativity, where we inspire brands and people to impact the world.

Curated by Ogilvy Consulting, Nudgestock is back for its 12th year - and this year, we&#39;re uncovering the hidden power of Time.

To many of us, time is nothing more than a series of moments. But look at it through the eyes of a behavioural scientist and you&#39;ll see it holds untold influence. Time is me and you. Time is your customers and citizens. Time is what makes businesses thrive and brands iconic.

Put simplyâ€¦ the more we understand how we humans are shaped by time, the more we can wisely spend our own. Are you ready to harness the power of time?
