### Rory Sutherland â€“ Are We Now Too Impatient to Be Intelligent? | Nudgestock 2024

**Are we too impatient to be intelligent?**

**Books Mentioned**
The unaccountability machine
Algorithms to live by


It is not always better to be going faster
	**Time = Distance / Speed**
	**As speed increases, each additional increase in speed results in less time saved for the same distance traveled.**

**In the modern world most of the decisions that are being made are not by people but my optimization models. These programs don't always consider human preferences, so they might make choices that aren't what we want.**

- For example google maps will choose to lead people down a more dangerous path if it is more efficient than to optimize for a more scenic view that takes a little longer.Â 
- **However humans actually often derive more satisfaction from slower, enjoyable experiences than from faster alternatives.** This insight encourages businesses to redesign services for pleasure rather than just efficiency.
- **Human psychology is ambiguous and often ignored in optimization models.**


**In life there are things that you may want to be more efficient however there are also things in life where the value comes from the process that the final result,**
- For example when writing essays, now you could be more efficient and just as Chat GPT to write the essay for you but the value of writing the essay is not so a machine can write it for is the though process behind writing the essay that is valuable, the critical thinking skills you gain from that process is what is important not the result or grade you get from the essay
- This is similar in advertising, many companies may will not try to same s money by using. LLM to generate. Their advertising campaigns but the real value comes from the process of creating the campaign to fully understand your own product and you users.
