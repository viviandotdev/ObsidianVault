### How to Lose Time and Money

> So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you&#39;d asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I&#39;d have said by spending all their money. That&#39;s how it happens in books and movies, because that&#39;s the colorful way to do it. But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments

> t&#39;s hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking &quot;wow, I&#39;m spending a lot of money.&quot; Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an eye

> spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn&#39;t. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you&#39;ve already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You&#39;re not spending the money; you&#39;re just moving it from one asset to another. Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say &quot;it&#39;s an investment.&quot;

> alarms that prevent you from overspending are so basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes fairly counterintuitive.

> the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they&#39;re not even fun.
