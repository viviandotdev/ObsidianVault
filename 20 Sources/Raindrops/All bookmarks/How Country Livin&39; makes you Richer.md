### How Country Livin makes you Richer

Living in the countryside, singly deuces your Temptations because there is less things to do when you were in the city you are constantly surrounded by multiple different coffee, shops, many different restaurants and places and things to do which are expensive for example someone who makes $100,000 a year in the city on paper might be richer than someone who makes $50,000 on the countryside, but the rate that the person in the city is Spending the money is significantly higher, causing them to live paycheck to paycheck and not be able to save it all making them actually much poor than someone making significantly less on the country side living the city are constantly comparing themselves to the peers so if they see someone with something better, they would also want to buy it And never ending cycle

  

Personally I really like the balance of living in Queens and being in the middle between Manhattan and flushing I feel like I get both the benefits of living in somewhat like countryside or if I walk outside Iâ€™m not constantly bombarded or overwhelmed by the amount of things are going on also it is also I like that itâ€™s also a slight inconvenience for me to go into the city this reduces my temptations to spend money because I am not bombarded by all of the things to do in the city or as for example Chris, who lives in Manhattan definitely has a different perspective. Second, she stepped outside. She is consumed by all of the things that the city has to offer, which and the temptations are easier for her to give in because they are literally right outside for doorstep or ask for me. I would have to get on a train for 15 minutes, and then get on a train back which is like a total of two hours of transportation that makes it difficult or harder for me to give into those temptations of all the restaurants that good in the city just give me both the benefits of saving money but also enjoying spending some time with my friends in the city if they want to, for example on a weekend or they were most people donâ€™t have class work. I can easily travel into the city and hang out there and when I am alone, I can just stay at home and which will save me a lot of money.
