### Why we wait: Understanding the emotions behind procrastination

Procrastination is your body and your brain trying to communicate a state of emotional struggle. Ignoring that message leads to more negative emotions, but embracing procrastination and trying to decipher the message can help you get unstuck while protecting your mental health.

> DUST is a simple method to identify why you may be procrastinating. It stands for the four most common reasons why we procrastinate: Difficult, Unclear, Scary, and Tedious.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Difficult. You may find the task too challenging, which may be caused by a lack of confidence, a lack of skills, or both. The solution is to move the starting point a bit earlier. For example, if you want to build an app but find it too difficult, you could take an online course that covers a very similar type of app. It‚Äôs important to not use an earlier starting point as a way to procrastinate even further. Clearly define what the first action step will entail, commit to it, and do not create an endless list of ‚Äúpre-tasks‚Äù before you can get started with the main task.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Unclear. Sometimes, we procrastinate because the task is not clearly defined. We often use vague one-word items in our to-do list, leaving our brains to fill in the blanks. In order to be productive, it‚Äôs important to have clearly defined actions. The solution is to make your tasks more detailed and to break them down into simple, actionable, clearly defined items. For example, ‚Äúpresentation prep‚Äù could be replaced by ‚Äúrecord myself presenting the talk by Tuesday so I can get feedback from my manager on Wednesday.‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Scary. Our fear of failure can get in the way of our productivity. The biggest changes we want to make and the most exciting projects we want to work are also the most daunting. Our brain is designed in a way to keep us safe. Comfort is good, risk is bad. Procrastination is a way to stay in your comfort zone. A solution is to create an even bigger fear to trump the original one. For example, announcing your deadline in public may trigger your fear of being judged, helping you overcome procrastination to avoid disappointing your peers. However, it‚Äôs better over the long term to embrace these fears, which are perfectly natural reactions to have when building something meaningful.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Tedious. Some tasks are just boring. Need to copy-and-paste lots of numbers into a spreadsheet? Need to clean up some data? Need to write a hundred handwritten notes for an event? There‚Äôs no way to change the nature of the task itself‚Äîeven though learning some automation tools can be useful in many cases‚Äîbut you can change your environment. For example, you could listen to a podcast while doing copy-and-pasting work. Or you could create a reward for yourself when you get the task done in order to make it more exciting.
