### How to Do Great Work



#### Highlights

&gt;You&#39;ll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s
&gt;good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries
&gt;come from noticing connections between different fields.

> Don&#39;t let &quot;work&quot;
&gt;mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do
&gt;great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Jun 09 2024 19:08:49 GMT-0400

> choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier,
&gt;notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone
&gt;who&#39;s done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.

&gt;desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and
&gt;that combination is the most powerful of all.

> When you read
&gt;biographies of people who&#39;ve done great work, it&#39;s remarkable how
&gt;much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result
&gt;of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.
&gt;So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to
&gt;do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people,
&gt;read lots of books, ask lots of questions.

> If you&#39;re making something for people, make sure it&#39;s something
&gt;they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something
&gt;you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool
&gt;you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests,
&gt;this will also get you your initial audience.

> In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard
&gt;on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of
&gt;it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try
&gt;to preserve certain invariants

> Lots of great things began with someone saying &quot;How hard could it
&gt;be?&quot;This is one case where the young have an advantage. They&#39;re more
&gt;optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism
&gt;is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.

&gt;consistency. People who do great things don&#39;t get a lot done every
&gt;day. They get something done, rather than nothing.

&gt;effort; when there&#39;s something you need to redo, status quo bias
&gt;and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat
&gt;this ask: If I&#39;d already made the change, would I want to revert
&gt;to what I have now?
