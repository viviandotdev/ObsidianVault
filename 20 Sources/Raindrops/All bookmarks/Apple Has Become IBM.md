### Apple Has Become IBM
**Summary**- **When a company becomes so successful that it turns into a monopoly, the product developers are no longer the ones determining the success of the company. Instead, the sales and marketing teamsâ€”who may lack the technical knowledge and appreciation for the effort required to create a great productâ€”take over, which can ultimately lead to the company's downfall.** This is what happened to IBM and Xerox. As product people are replaced by sales and marketers, the company stops innovating, allowing a new competitor like Microsoft to easily catch up and replace it.

**When a company becomes a monopoly, it tends to stop innovating**. This is what will eventually happen to Apple. When a company owns the entire market share, the quality of its product becomes less relevant; it's primarily about selling it. Similar to Pepsi and Coca-Cola, their products have been essentially the same since their inception; they're just sugared water. However, they've mastered the art of selling and marketing their products through celebrity endorsements to increase sales from the same customer base. 

Over time, as a product improves significantly, **it's no longer the engineers driving the sales and success of the company; it's the sales and marketing teams**. For instance, after the iPhone X, the changes in subsequent iPhone models have been minimal. We have likely reached the peak of engineering with iPhones. Now, Apple invests heavily in sales and marketing because **technological innovation is no longer the primary driver of sales.**

In the past, I was really excited when a new iPhone was released, as the new tech features often motivated me to buy them. However, now the new features are barely noticeable, and since I don't easily fall for marketing tactics, I no longer feel the need to purchase new iPhones anymore.
