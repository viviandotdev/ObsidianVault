### Apple Has Become IBM

When a company becomes a monopoly it no longer innovates, this is the same thing that will happen to apple.
Overtime when a product gets so good the engineers are no longer the ones driving the sales and success of the company it is the sales and marketing people.
For example after the iPhone X the changes in the iPhone have been minimal, we have reached the peak of enginering with iphones. Now apple pours a lot of money into sales and marketing because technological innocation is not longer driving sales. 
Back then I was really excited when a new iPhone came out and the new tech features were usually what made me want to buy them.
But they that the new features are barely noticable and I don't easily fall for marketing tactics I no longer feel the need to buy iPhones any more
