> Rule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What&#39;s a zero day? A zero day is when you don&#39;t do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I&#39;m not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that&#39;s not the point. The point I&#39;m trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system. Didnt&#39; do anything all fucking day and it&#39;s 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero.
