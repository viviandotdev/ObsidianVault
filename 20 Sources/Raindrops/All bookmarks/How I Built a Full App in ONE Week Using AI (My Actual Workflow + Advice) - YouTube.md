### How I Built a Full App in ONE Week Using AI (My Actual Workflow + Advice) - YouTube

#### 4 step work flow to building features with AI 
- build the basic UI only with dummy data
```
Create a meeting detail screen in SwiftUl with hardcoded transcript data. Include a header with the meeting title, date, and duration. Below that, show the transcript with different speakers highlighted in different colors.
```
- data structures and the backend
```
Based on the Ul we've built, create a data model for meetings, transcripts, and messages. Then generate the SQL commands to set up a Supabase database to store this data.
```
- connect the UI and backend
```
Update the MeetingListView to fetch real meetings from Supabase instead of using dummy data. Add loading states and error handling.
```
- UI polish

1. be hyper specific
2. provider visual context
3. don't do too much, do small iterations quickly
	if you ask for too much it can easily get confused
