### How to (Mostly) Never Run Out of Things To Say.

Not everyone is great at communicating, even if they wish they could be. I hope my experiences can help change that, so that the next time we meet new people or find ourselves in a dry patch, we can get out of it, and have a more fufilling social life.


1. Active listening
2. Be genuinely curious about what they are talking about
3. When people say something they often leave out a lot of context, so just ask more questions

1. I cut my hand on Sunday while working on a car.
	1. What kind of car?
	2. Was it your car
	3. How did you cut it?
	4. Can I see it?, did it hurt
	5. Do you work on cars?
	6. Do you work on cars often on Sundays?

2. I like to watch Tour de France

1. Do you know when the competition is?
2. Where do you watch it? Just clips on YouTube?
3. How fast are they going on those bikes?
4. Do know how to ride bikes?
5. What time of year is it? is it going on now?

3. I went to korea?
	1. do you live in korea?
	2. how long have you lived there?
	3. do your parents live there?
	4. do you like living there?

4. i went to europe
	1. what did you do there?
	2. who did you go with?
	3. how did you meet them?
	4. from a climbing gym?
	5. how much was your ticket?
	6. how long was your stay?

If you are genuinely curious about something and want to learn more about it there is no such thing as a stupid question.
