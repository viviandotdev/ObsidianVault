### How Country Livin makes you Richer.


**Living in the countryside significantly reduces your temptations because there are fewer things to do.** In the city, you are constantly surrounded by numerous coffee shops, many different restaurants, and various activities that tend to be expensive. For example, someone who makes $100,000 a year in the city might appear to be richer than someone who makes $50,000 in the countryside. However, the rate at which the person in the city is spending their money is significantly higher, causing them to live paycheck to paycheck without the ability to save. This situation may make them actually much poorer than someone earning significantly less in the countryside.

Moreover, people living in the city are constantly comparing themselves to their peers. If they see someone with something better, they feel compelled to buy it, leading to a never-ending cycle of consumption.

Personally, I really like the balance of living in Queens, as it places me in the middle between Manhattan and Flushing. I feel like I get the benefits of living somewhat like in the countryside; when I walk outside, Iâ€™m not constantly bombarded or overwhelmed by all the activities going on around me. 

**I also appreciate that itâ€™s a slight inconvenience for me to go into the city.** This reduces my temptations to spend money because I am not bombarded by all the things to do there. In contrast, people who lives in Manhattan, definitely has a different perspective. The moment they step outside, they are surrounded by everything the city has to offer, making it easier for her to give in to temptations.

As for me, I would have to get on a train for 60 minutes and then another train back, totaling about two hours of transportation, which makes it harder for me to succumb to the temptations of all the great restaurants in the city. This arrangement allows me to benefit from saving money while still enjoying time with my friends in the city if they want to meet up, for example, on weekends I can easily travel into the city to hang out, and when I am alone, I can just stay home, which saves me a lot of money.
