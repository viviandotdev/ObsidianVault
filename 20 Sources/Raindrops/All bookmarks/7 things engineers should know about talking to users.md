> 4. What to ask during user interviewsOur experience of talking to users has revealed two main discussion areas. The first is problem exploration. This guides future product decisions, like what to build next. Focus on concrete situations by asking questions like:What is your workflow for solving this problem? Can you talk me through it?How are you solving your problem right now?How often do you do this?Why is it important?What&#39;s challenging about it?The second is solution validation. This works best when someone is already using your feature or you have a demo to show them. Focus on impressions and problem areas by asking questions like:Have you tried using X? If not, why not?How are you using X now? What are your touch points with X?What is confusing?Can you show me how you are using X?Follow-up questions are critical to get the depth needed to build a good solution, too. Remember, this is an opportunity to solve your information bottleneck. Do this by asking questions like:What do you mean by that?Why is that important to you?Can you tell me more?Ask one question at a time. Focus on listening. Get more specific as the interview goes on.
