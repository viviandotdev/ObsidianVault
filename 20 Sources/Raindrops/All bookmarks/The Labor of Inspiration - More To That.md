### The Labor of Inspiration - More To That

There&#39;s both magic and dedication within the anatomy of inspiration.

> When I first started writing, I did so only when the desire emerged.

> One day of this may be fine, but what if it becomes one week? Or one month? Or one year? At what point does your belief in inspirationâ€™s whimsical nature become a form of justified procrastination?

>
> A laborer shows up to his job at a set time, works for a set number of hours, and does so for a set number of days each week. Everything is mapped out in advance, and he simply needs to show up to get things in motion.

>
> From the perspective of the laborer, you create your own inspiration

>
> Itâ€™s much more enticing to go for a walk and read books than it is to sit and organize your thoughts onto a page.

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Feb 18 2024 15:46:41 GMT-0500
>
> And if this goes on for long enough, youâ€™ll believe that youâ€™re living the life of a writer without actually writing anything in the first place.

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Feb 18 2024 15:46:41 GMT-0500
>
> When you schedule creativity, you develop an expectation of yourself to produce something during that time. It doesnâ€™t have to be good, but there has to be something.

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Feb 18 2024 15:46:41 GMT-0500
>
> If the next 24 hours are all that matters, then youâ€™ll be much more attentive to how you spend your time and energy.

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Feb 18 2024 15:46:41 GMT-0500
>
> I set a timer for ~2 hours each weekday morning, and use that time to write

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Feb 18 2024 15:46:41 GMT-0500
>
> But whether the result is good or not, the laborer has done its job, and that fact alone makes your day a productive one.

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Feb 18 2024 15:46:41 GMT-0500
>
> In the end, I probably wonâ€™t be as great as the writer who writes for 8 hours each day, but Iâ€™ll probably be the happier one.

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Feb 18 2024 15:46:41 GMT-0500
>
> If you do this regularly, youâ€™ll notice that time isnâ€™t the bottleneck, but the way you use your attention. Instead of checking your work email for the 50th time, youâ€™ll spend it reading something that fulfills your curiosity

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Feb 18 2024 15:46:41 GMT-0500
>
> Instead of mindlessly scrolling social media during your lunch break, youâ€™ll jot down ideas you want to build upon. This will allow you to regularly absorb inspiration from the outside, which you can then express through discipline from the inside.
