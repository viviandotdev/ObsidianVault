How AI Could Transform the World for the Better


AI has the potential to transform the world in ways that most people don't even think off.
The main way AI is able to do this is through speeding up development processes

> If our core hypothesis about AI progress is correct, then the right way to think of AI is not as a method of data analysis, but as a virtual biologist who performs all the tasks biologists do, including designing and running experiments in the real world (by controlling lab robots or simply telling humans which experiments to run â€“ as a Principal Investigator would to their graduate students), inventing new biological methods or measurement techniques, and so on. It is by speeding up the whole research process that AI can truly accelerate biology. I want to repeat this because itâ€™s the most common misconception that comes up when I talk about AIâ€™s ability to transform biology: I am not talking about AI as merely a tool to analyze data. In line with the definition of powerful AI at the beginning of this essay, Iâ€™m talking about using AI to perform, direct, and improve upon nearly everything biologists do.
