Time wealth is more important than money
One of the best predictors of well being is the freedom and flexibility to over one's life,
For example there is no amount of money that can be paid for to go back in the the office.
The time wealth i get from working remote is more worth it to me.
I get to work on my interests and still be able to work a full time is everything I could want

> Itâ€™s commonly said that money doesnâ€™t buy happiness, but time can come pretty close. Having time means more opportunities to recharge, take care of yourself, and invest in relationships. It also means less background stress, and fewer arguments with your partner about whose turn it is to watch the kids. Time may not make happiness, but it can definitely make happiness easier.
