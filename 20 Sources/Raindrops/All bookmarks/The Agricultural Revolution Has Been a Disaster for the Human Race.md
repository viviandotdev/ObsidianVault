### The Agricultural Revolution Has Been a Disaster for the Human Race


Our body is not designed to live in modern society, The agricultural revolution changed the way live and may have created more problems than it solved
The main problem the agriculture revolution solved was food, we are now able to get food very easily however, maybe it was not meant to be this way. Because instead of hunting for our food we just sit around all day and wait for the food to be served to us, This has been detrimintal for our health a
## Spencer Wells' Pandora's Seed: A Critical Look at Modern Society

Spencer Wells' "Pandora's Seed" and the "Insight" podcast explore a provocative idea: **modern society, despite its advancements, might be inherently unhealthy for humans.** We may be fundamentally built for a lifestyle that no longer exists. 

**The Argument:**

* **We are not designed for modern life**: Our bodies evolved for a hunter-gatherer existence, not the sedentary, high-calorie environment of today.
* **Advancements come at a cost**: While we enjoy lower infant mortality and less violence, modern society also carries a "hidden cost" in the form of increased morbidity. 
* **Agriculture as a turning point**: The shift to agriculture, while increasing lifespan, might have made us less *healthy*. 
* **Life expectancy vs. health span**: Modern society's focus on extending lifespan may be misleading. Are we truly healthier, or simply living longer with more chronic conditions?
* **A pessimistic view of "Paleo Life": **  While the average lifespan in the Paleolithic era was shorter (around 35 years), it's argued that this might have been our biological design.  Conditions like menopause and testosterone decline might be less problematic if we lived within this natural lifespan. 
* **Aging population and economic burden**: A large population of elderly individuals can strain an economy, especially if they are not contributing economically.  
* **Disease patterns:**
    * **Paleolithic era:** Death often came from trauma and childbirth.
    * **Post agriculture:**  Infectious diseases became more prevalent due to denser populations. Modern diseases like diabetes and cancer are linked to our modern diet and lack of physical activity.
* **Height as an indicator**:  Average height declined after agriculture, suggesting a decline in overall health. 
* **Diet and oral health**:  Our modern diet, rich in sugars, has led to a need for dental hygiene practices like brushing, which were not necessary in the Paleolithic era.

**Key takeaways:**

*  Modern society's "progress" may mask underlying health issues.
* We need to re-evaluate the true impact of agriculture and its long-term consequences.
* We may need to rethink our relationship with our bodies and our environment.
