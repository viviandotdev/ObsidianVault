### How To Become Decisive

Certainly! Here is the reformatted text:

---

### Why you should learn to become more decisive?
**Most people are struggling to survive and doing just enough to survive to the next day or the next week.**
They are not interested in health, not educated, and not conscious. They are chasing basic instincts and desires while avoiding their deepest features.
**Making high-quality decisions gives you clarity and peace of mind.**

### How make more decisions?

**Lack of Clarity**
Clarity is the key to decision-making. You need to be clear about exactly what you want out of life. If you know what you want, making decisions on the micro level becomes easy. All you need to ask yourself is if what you are doing now will bring you closer to your goal in life.

**What character do you want to be?**

- I want to provide value.
- Make a decision and stick to it. It is NOT efficient to be indecisive.
- For example, if you want to eat healthy, donâ€™t be indecisive about it. Donâ€™t be wishy-washy and say, "I will eat it just once." Being indecisive is exhausting. Every little thing you have to think about takes up mental capacity, whereas you can just do it.

**Indecisiveness**

I am too indecisive. I want to see all my options and weigh them. I think the best solution is to just **execute on what you think is best now, make a clear decision, and move on. If in the future you want to change it, you can, but just focus on what is relevant now.**

With coding, I often think about over-optimizing before it is necessary. I want the code to be clean and the best. However, instead, I can just code it until it works. Write bad code in order to write good code. [[You must write bad code before you can write good code.]]

### Tips to help you make a decision

- Most decisions can be remade. **Making the wrong decisions helps you figure out the right decision**. If you make the wrong decision, itâ€™s okay because **it is much easier to correct the decision than just stalling and wasting time not doing anything at all**. You can iterate on the wrong decision to make it better.

Stop stalling because you are afraid to fail. Make the decision.

You need to get the failure reps in fast and often so that you can eventually succeed. If you are constantly stalling and not making a clear decision to move you forward, you will never be able to fail, and if you cannot fail, you cannot succeed. Making the wrong choices will give you experience to make a better choice in the future.

SO JUST MAKE A CHOICE. It doesnâ€™t really matter what it is. For example, I spent so much time deciding. When you make a choice, write it down and make it concrete. Execute it first and then change it later.

---

**Bias Towards Action**

Your decisions should push you forward into action, not stalling. Itâ€™s okay; you can make both decisions, but first take action on one. If you do it and donâ€™t like it, you can execute the second one. Just donâ€™t waste too much time in limbo deciding. Pick one, execute on it. If it works, stick with it. If it does not work, then try the other one.
