### 7 Life Goals I now think are a waste of time -- Reflections of a 60 year old retired man.

I&#39;m 60 years old and retired... here are 7 life goals I believe now to be a waste of time.   Can I retire now.  Retirement Planning.
------------------------------------------------------------
_*PLEASE STOP USING Spreadsheets!_ It falls way short optimizing every retirement factor*
Retirement Tool Link I reference and use and recommend -- Boldin (old name: New Retirement)
 Free 2 week trial.   $120/yr after.   You will buy this after trying (I have purchased for 5 years ).   

* NEW NAME: BOLDIN    All my old links will continue to work for your free trial!*

--------------------------------------------------------------------

*Need a CFP to create your professional retirement plan for a one time fee?* My Recommendation:  Neil Fortwendel    (812) 471-2492.  Neil created my plan.  Plan updates as you wish for a smaller fee.   Check Neil out on Facebook and LinkedIn.   Average Cost: $4000
