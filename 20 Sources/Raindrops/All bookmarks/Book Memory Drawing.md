### Book: Memory Drawing

> I understand why: you want to believe you can draw anything if you can deconstruct a subject into three-dimensional forms. And this is true, but there are better paths to mastery. Rembrandt didnâ€™t do form studies. I suspect Kim Jung Gi didnâ€™t, either. You see him drawing form often, but I suspect he was trying to tell us that was what he saw in his mind as he drewâ€”again, a mental thing happening in the artistâ€™s brain.

> You can expand this ability, remember even more, and learn to visualize it on the page before drawing it. You can even access visual information hidden in your brain! Your brain doesnâ€™t just simplify things to symbols; it does also store what things look like. You need to train to access this information through, you guessed it, memory drawing. While drawing from imagination, you will discover that you will remember what things look like without consciously studying them!

&gt;
&gt;Thatâ€™s it.
&gt;
&gt;Drawing from memory is an intense exercise; initially, you should do only one daily for 15 minutes.

> You will rapidly get better at memorizing more complex things, and you can do the exercise several times during the day. For example, when you are out and about and waiting somewhere, instead of grabbing your phone, you can memorize something you see around you to draw it from memory later when you have access to drawing tools. This way, you can do drawing exercises even without drawing tools!

> One particularly cool thing about the memory drawing exercise is that it can scale with your ability. You can start by memorizing something really simpleâ€”two curved linesâ€”all the way up to memorizing many people in complex poses and costumes. You can do this as a satisfying short warm-up for the rest of your lif

> Drawing from memory instead makes you better at visualizing what you want to draw and better at sensing when lines feel right or wrong. You will become better at noticing what is off in your drawing and effectively become your own teacher, seeing the mistakes in your drawings yourself. The memory drawing exercise is that great.

> You will repeat the thirteen drawing exercise assignments after that for several days each. You can find sufficient reference images to work from in the back. I recommend re-reading the same chapter each day before you do the exercise. You may notice something you havenâ€™t seen before, and repetition helps you commit the information to long-term memory

> I did something from memory (M), observation (O), and imagination (I), and I write down where the reference came from (Heinrich Kley mainly in this case). If I do more than one memory drawing, I will mark them M1, M2, etc., so you can see the progress when doing multiple memory drawings from the same reference.

> After doing the memory exercise for the first time and before doing it the second time with the same reference:
&gt;
&gt;1. Note what you got wrong.
&gt;2. Write it down, and make a quick, small, rough sketch from observation where you draw it correctly.
&gt;3. Do pay careful attention and try to memorize.

> A unique form of reference collecting is memorizing something you see during the day and drawing it from memory the next day or later in the day. Youâ€™ll find that you are more free to augment what you memorized with imagined details as it was recorded in your mind much earlier. And this is a form of drawing you can do when you donâ€™t have drawing tools with you! Close your eyes and draw it in your mind while standing before it; open your eyes, notice things you got wrong, and try again. People wonâ€™t see that youâ€™re drawing in your mind. Then, draw it on paper the next day.
