### The Plan Is To Make You Permanently Poorer | Aaron Meets Gary Stevenson

The Capitalist system that is currently used to day is continues to give money to rich without any method of getting that money, because of this wealth inequality has increased dramatically.
One solution gary proposes is to tax assets, the things that rich people have that poor people don't are assets. Rich people have assets sitting there that are making them richer faster.
This is why the rich buy homes and go into real estate, it is one of the easiest ways to make money.

During the 2008 crisis the government decreased interest rates to stimulate the economy, with lower interest rates the rich could borrow as much money as they wanted from the bank and put them into assets such as homes.
When interest rates lowered, the only people that could benefits were the rich because they were only people the bank would loan the money to.  In contrast, lower-income individuals lacked access to such opportunities.

## The Young Trader's Dilemma

At 23, an extremely young and talented trader made $400,000 in one year. This was a stark contrast to his father's $20,000 annual income, earned through hard work starting at 5 AM every day. The trader felt a sense of unfairness and hesitated to share his success with others. His mathematical prowess landed him a trading job at City at the onset of the 2008 crisis.

## A Unique Perspective

Growing up poor, he maintained his relationships with friends and family who continued to struggle. Meanwhile, he observed how the wealthy navigated the post-2008 crisis landscape.

## Interest Rates and Economic Inequality

- **Post-2008 Crisis**: Interest rates remained at 0% for about 12 years. Economists consistently predicted increases, but were wrong each year.
- **Impact on Wealth Distribution**: Low interest rates primarily benefited the rich, who could borrow at 0% to invest in assets, amplifying their wealth. In contrast, lower-income individuals lacked access to such opportunities.

## Media and Financial Analysis

Financial analysis in the media often serves as entertainment rather than information. Analysts face no consequences for incorrect predictions, as illustrated by an economist who failed to recognize his repeated errors regarding interest rates.

## The Role of Interest Rates

- **Economic Stimulation**: Low interest rates aim to stimulate the economy by reducing borrowing costs, encouraging spending and investment, and reducing unemployment.
- **Economic Inequality**: Low rates increase asset prices, benefiting wealthier individuals who own these assets, thereby widening the wealth gap.

## Government Stimulus and Wealth Distribution

- **Stimulus Checks**: Intended to help people pay for essentials, but much of the money ultimately benefits the rich.
- **Wealth Redistribution**: The economic system favors the rich, lacking mechanisms to reclaim wealth during crises, leading to unsustainable practices.

## Housing Prices vs. Wages

Housing prices rise while wages stagnate. The government needs to communicate the disparity in wealth distribution clearly. During COVID-19, average families saved modest amounts, while wealthy families accumulated substantial cash reserves.

## Taxing the Rich

- **Asset Ownership**: Rich individuals own tangible assets that can be taxed.
- **Economic System Flaws**: The system is designed to enrich the wealthy without effective means of redistribution.

## Summary

- **Wealth Inequality**: Government actions often exacerbate wealth inequality by disproportionately benefiting the rich.
- **Asset Prices vs. Wages**: Asset prices have surged compared to wages over the past decade.
- **Taxation Challenges**: Taxing the rich is necessary but must be balanced to maintain incentives for entrepreneurship.
- **Interest Rates and Asset Costs**: Post-2008, low interest rates led to rising asset costs, as cheap borrowing fueled property purchases, reducing supply and increasing prices.
