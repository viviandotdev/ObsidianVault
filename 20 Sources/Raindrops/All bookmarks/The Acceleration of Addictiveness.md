&gt;In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something
&gt;that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something
&gt;movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of
&gt;addicts do outside the doors of office buildings.  A lot of the
&gt;change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation
&gt;couldn&#39;t have happened if customs hadn&#39;t already changed.It took a while thoughâ€”on the order of 100 years.  And unless the
&gt;rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the
&gt;accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new
&gt;addictions, we&#39;ll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to
&gt;protect us
