### How I study and build my Visual Library

The only way to learn and build your Visual Library is by studying and interrogating yourself regularly. In other words; study, interrogate, fix, repeat.

> Before starting to work, I schedule at least one hour to study an object of choice. Often times I just go with the topic I decide for the Weekly Challenge Facebook group. I make sure I have sufficient reference pictures of the subject. That means; I have references of every angle. These images have preferably a high resolution as well, so I can zoom in of needed to study the minor details
&gt;With the reference images as support I start drawing the object from different angles. That way I practice my perspective skills but I also have to think where each part the object has to go. By doing so, Iâ€™m already forced to think and construct the image in my mind before even touching the paper.
&gt;To finish the studies, I sometimes reference my favourite artist and see how they draw / render something (ie. a tire of a car). I like to apply the same rendering process on my studies. Thatâ€™s called smart-stealing.
