For me, the practice of writing and revising notes is, at its core, about trying to move up the following rough ladder:

Fleeting notes
Prompt notes
Evergreen notes

- Ephemeral scratchings in [Daily working log](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXRs9fj5BuX5FmrQzPxqWUs)
- ==Prompts and incomplete notes in writing inbox ([A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUP4GuzPF33dWkZPiu9N6V5)), which are meant to possibly become [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX). ==These prompts may accumulate writing over time via spaced repetition (see [Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to incrementally develop inklings](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSK4LyrCbG9zDrdCWmcovUW))
- [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX), in increasingly complex stages of development:
	- stubs implicitly defined through backlinks ([Backlinks can be used to implicitly define nodes in knowledge management systems](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zL9q21MA7ygsKVfvn6FwBMq)); e.g. [Note-writing system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zGKtrhpZ3hS8bw8UGL8hMTP), [Audiobooks](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zG91aqpyGEiy8McMHAW7juq)
	- simple definitions for terms of art, little of my own added; e.g. [Span of absolute judgment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zMQK1sFXWbVMbSQAsjSTUvm), [Spacing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4KScVkQCD2XmVwvSDUbZtn)
	- [Bridge notes narrowly relate two adjacent terms](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zRxv4aMPUXowy5bPAiKPJEy)
	- precise, narrow declarative notes ([Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zLhoRUyjKU665EY16u4XXJy)); e.g. [Human channel capacity increases with stimulus dimensionality](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z86ZRZ5s5ykUzGD8v8d33ro)
	- sometimes these are framed as questions, when evidence is too inconclusive to frame sharply; e.g. [To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3CX38AdFzNGcujEwctVj5X), [To what extent can application prompts supplant recall prompts in the mnemonic medium?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zMPNEnSC5ihp5MNMdxNJNdJ)
	- higher-level APIs ([Evergreen note titles are like APIs](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zDh1yhNFQNxDEre12B4zd8k))
	- notes abstracting over many other notes, e.g. [Educational games are a doomed approach to creating enabling environments](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUVBJdPc4kBud5fsLmPFpbw), [Reading texts on computers is unpleasant](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2bSwDuxY2Jbv1ntLKB3SL1)
	- personal terms of art, e.g. [Enacted experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z92TGMiBsnraf5KXxSTNkBJ)
- “Outline notes”, e.g. [§Enabling environments, games, and the Primer](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zGSGS1UHDogPKtvZB5hdT2A)

Note types outside this ladder:

- Proper noun notes
	- “Literature notes”, titled after a single work and meant primarily as linkages to other more durable notes, and as targets for backlinks. I write these roughly as “outline notes,” except for someone else’s ideas. For example: [Miller - The magical number seven, plus or minus two](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNCrrN6aGXeuiVXgnoiT7ND)
	- Likewise, but less commonly, I also have “person notes” (e.g. [Anand Agarawala](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zLXY8Ru3EzeKyjhqoYgCJD7)) and “business notes” (e.g. [Confluent](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQ2vjssuHu3869yDHpTmYbm))
	- These note types are weakly evergreen. I may add to them over time, but because they aren’t concept-oriented ([Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2hQEhqWkdRLL9JUwfawZZx)), they’re not as useful to build on as an evergreen note. Non-trivial writing about proper nouns typically gets factored into separate evergreen notes which can be used in multiple places.
	- “Log” notes, which accumulate ephemeral observations about a specific practice, system, or project over time. They’re akin to a [Daily working log](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXRs9fj5BuX5FmrQzPxqWUs), but sliced by some topic of interest rather than by date. e.g. [Log: personal mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Log%3A_personal_mnemonic_medium)
	- With better transclusion or support for [Contextual backlinks](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQtMfVrh8x4paaZv7MTp1Em), such notes could be written directly in one’s [Daily working log](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXRs9fj5BuX5FmrQzPxqWUs), and “log” notes could be defined as a query over such notes.

Tactically speaking, I usually denote a note’s “type” with a tag.

Don’t over-obsess or over-formalize this stuff. Remember: [“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zAf4oNSV9qB38ncSvYEZGAb).
