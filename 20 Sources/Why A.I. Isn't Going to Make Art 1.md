When you are writing fiction, you are—consciously or unconsciously—making a choice about almost every word you type; to oversimplify, we can imagine that a ten-thousand-word short story requires something on the order of ten thousand choices. **When you give a generative-A.I. program a prompt, you are making very few choices.**

There are various ways it can do this. One is to take an average of the choices that other writers have made, as represented by text found on the Internet; **that average is equivalent to the least interesting choices possible, which is why A.I.-generated text is often really bland.**

**The selling point of generative A.I. is that these programs generate vastly more than you put into them, and that is precisely what prevents them from being effective tools for artists.**

In essence, they are saying that art can be all inspiration and no perspiration—but these things cannot be easily separated.

**Using ChatGPT to complete assignments is like bringing a forklift into the weight room; you will never improve your cognitive fitness that way.**

**Skill is how well you perform at a task, while intelligence is how efficiently you gain new skills.**

Computers will not be able to replace humans until they acquire that type of competence, and that is still a long way off; for the time being, we're just looking for jobs that can be done with turbocharged auto-complete.
