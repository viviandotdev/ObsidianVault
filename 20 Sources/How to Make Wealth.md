> if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars&#39; worth of pain. For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years.

> I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you&#39;re planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.

> A great programmer, on a roll, could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks. A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).

> Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of an institution. A more direct way to put it would be: you need to start doing something people want.

> Most employees&#39; work is tangled together. Suppose a company makes some kind of consumer gadget. The engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features; the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then the marketing people convince everyone that it&#39;s something they&#39;ve got to have. How do you know how much of the gadget&#39;s sales are due to each group&#39;s efforts? Or, for that matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave the company a reputation for quality? There&#39;s no way to untangle all their contributions. Even if you could read the minds of the consumers, you&#39;d find these factors were all blurred together

> An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.

> A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss.

> When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to measuring the contributions of individual employees. A viable startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a factor of ten of measuring individual effort.

> It&#39;s common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.

> For most people, the most powerful motivator is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss.
