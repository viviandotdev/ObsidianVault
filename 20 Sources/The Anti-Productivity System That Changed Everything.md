Most productivity advice looks good on Instagram… but falls apart in real life.  
  
Second brains, color-coded dashboards, 4-hour planning systems — they’re polished, but they’re not what actually got me through medical school, launched a business, and helped me perform consistently without burning out.  
  
In this video, I’m breaking down what I call “anti-productivity.”  
It’s not about rejecting tools — it’s about stripping away what doesn’t serve you… and finally becoming someone who can execute when it matters.  
  
🔍 What You’ll Learn:  
✅ Why most productivity systems are secretly slowing you down  
✅ The radical performance rule that changed my life  
✅ How to train your brain (literally) with dual n-back  
✅ The tools I actually use: simple, powerful, friction-free  
✅ How to build internal trust and clarity — without the clutter  
  
You don’t need 17 apps.  
You don’t need to track every minute.  
You need to become someone who can deliver.
