**Common Problems**
- Common 
**Personal Experience**
- you are over complicating your productivity organization system
- you might be spending more time organizing your system then actually using 
- i feel that with using obsidian i have spend more time thinking about how to organize my system then actually using the system 

**Potential Framework, System, or Solution**
- I will use a very **simple system for obsidian for creating notes and reviewing them**
- I will **stop trying to overcomplicate my system** 
- My **notes app is where I will keep all my fleeting notes** and ideas that are coming in and put. them into and organize later obsidian 
- He does not use an app like obisidan you uses an AI tool that auto categorizes his notes and makes them easy to find.
- Most things you should be able to find with a fuzzy search in obsidan
- You should bias towards getting the thing done and using the info instead of figuring out how to organize it.
- For example when I needed a screenshot I was paralyzed because i didn't know where to put it or save it.
- That extra overhead paralyzed me and my ability to move on so i felt stuck
- Your system should be a little disorganized
