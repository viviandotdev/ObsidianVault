### our conception of love is messed up. - YouTube

passive vs **active love**
love is out there waiting for you
people make themselves lovable instead of loving
everyone is trying to increase their market value 
focus on loving itself, 
	how do i become loved? (passive) vs how do i love? (active)
people want to be loved ******
love needs to be learned it is any activity
	requires **dedication, faith and effort**
	you should not only love when it is convenient and enjoyable for you
"fall in love "

love should be active and passive, it needs to be learned like an art such as painting or playing an instrcument it takes dedication and effort
love is not something that happens to you it is something you build and should full fill you
for example when a artist completes a painting it fullfill  them
