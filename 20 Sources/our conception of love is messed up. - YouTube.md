### our conception of love is messed up. - YouTube

passive vs **active love**
love is out there waiting for you
people make themselves lovable instead of loving
everyone is trying to increase their market value 
focus on loving itself, 
	how do i become loved? (passive) vs how do i love? (active)
people want to be loved 
love needs to be learned it is any activity
	requires **dedication, faith and effort**
	you should not only love when it is convenient and enjoyable for you
"fall in love "
