But is there anything else? When I ask that, the answer that pops up is **Make good new things.**

**The most impressive thing humans can do is to think. It may be the most impressive thing that can be done. And the best kind of thinking, or more precisely the best proof that one has thought well, is to make good new things.**

Indeed, trying to express what you understand is not just a way to prove that you understand it, but a way to understand it better.

So there's my guess at a set of principles to live by: **take care of people and the world, and make good new things.**

**Newton was driven by curiosity and ambition, not by any practical effect his work might have, and yet the practical effect of his work has been enormous.** And this seems the rule rather than the exception. So if you think you can make something amazing, you should probably just go ahead and do it.

Be driven by curiosity and ambition, success will follow as a byproduct. You don't need to worry about the practical impact of the things you create just create them if they are interesting to you and solve your own problems.
