### Stop Acting Like You're Famous

Save the money-making schemes for work, 
Find something you enjoy doing and do it because you enjoy
I want to make apps because I enjoy it, I like the process of make technology do what I want to do.
I want all of the decisions I make to be mine


**Stop acting like your famous no one gives a shit** about what you do just make it and put it out there
No one cares what you did, you don’t have to worry about being famous 
Why are you scared of the criticism when there is literally no one to give you the criticism

> The most egregious thing you can do with any activity is daydream about how you can make money off of it. That’s the quickest way to optimize for the wrong things and suck the fun right out of it. Most likely you will stop doing the activity almost immediately, so save the money-making schemes for work.
