Why I Erased 10,000 Notes, 7 Years of Ideas, and Every Thought I Tried to Save

When your vault has too many notes it can become a burden to maintain, it feels like you brain is a mess and feel disorganized. 
Maintaining a vault feels like I spend more time organizing instead of thinking.
Don't capture everything, only capture things that you will use and ideas that  resonate with you.
Delete notes often and keep your vault clean, remove outdated ideas, do not feel tied to your ideas, important ideas will always come back to you and will you find it again..
Life is like a spiral if you miss an opportunity it will always back to you eventually

> PKM systems promise coherence, but they often deliver a kind of abstracted confusion. The more I wrote into my vault, the less I felt. A quote would spark an insight, I’d clip it, tag it, link it - and move on. But the insight was never lived. It was stored. Like food vacuum-sealed and never eaten, while any nutritional value slips away.

> Worse, the architecture began to shape my attention. I started reading to extract. Listening to summarize. Thinking in formats I could file. Every experience became fodder. I stopped wondering and started processing.

> In trying to remember everything, I outsourced the act of reflection. I didn’t revisit ideas. I didn’t interrogate them. I filed them away and trusted the structure. But a structure is not thinking. A tag is not an insight. And an idea not re-encountered might as well have never been had

> My new system is, simply, no system at all. I write what I think. I delete what I don’t need. I don’t capture everything. I don’t try to. I read what I feel like. I think in conversation, in movement, in context. I don’t build a second brain. I inhabit the first
