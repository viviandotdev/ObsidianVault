## Mailbox


Creating the Envelope:
1. Create a cube.
2. Split the cube into 3 even parts.
3. Create diagonals for the flap using the "**Knife**" function.
	To apply double click and then enter
4. Extrude the flap and move it into position.

Crafting the Pole:
1. Use a cylinder to create the pole.
2. Add a bevel to the cylinder
3. Create a separate cylinder for the base of the pole.

Building the Mailbox:
1. Start with a cube as the base shape.
2. Add cuts to the bottom of the mailbox by switching to the side view and applying the cuts to both sides.
3. Apply the subdivision **surface modifier** to smooth out the mailbox.
4. Select the door of the mailbox and separate it from the main object.
5. Apply the **solidify** modifier to both the door and the mailbox to give them thickness.
6. Move the origin point of the door to the bottom-middle position to enable proper rotation when opening the door.

Designing the Flag:
1. Create a box and extrude it to form the desired shape of the flag.
2. Apply the subdivision surface modifier to the flag for a smoother appearance.

Adding the Pivot Point:
1. Create a pivot point for the flag.
2. Duplicate the rod (pole) and scale it down to create the pivot point.

Final Steps:
- Assemble all the created components (envelope, pole, mailbox, flag, and pivot point) to complete the final model.

By following these steps, you can create a detailed mailbox model with an envelope, pole, mailbox, flag, and pivot point in Blender or any other 3D modeling software.
