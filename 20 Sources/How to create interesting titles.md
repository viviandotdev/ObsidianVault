## How to create interesting titles

You should generate 5-10 titles for videos
Titles are more important than you think and it is the reason why people click on the video
Youtube videos are mostly discovered through **browse** **not search.**
Browse has the potential for viral growth

You want your titles to be intriguing, "click baity" and grabs the readers attention.

1. **Sell the result** instead of the process- what user will learn and get from the video
	1. How i Type REALLY fast (156 words per minutes)
	2. Intrigue- How i Remember everything i read
		- Describe-My System for Taking Notes from Books
			- Why would someone want to take notes from books?
				- Taking notes is the process to help people remember what they read. The goal of taking notes to remeber what you read
				- The pain point is remembering what you read
	1. Result- How i beat imposter syndrome
		1. Process- The Power of the Spotlight Effect
	2. How i become a better speaker

2. **Intrigue vs agreement**
	Put a question in the mind of the viewer instead of agreement
	1. Why having fun leads to more productivity (already gives views the answer)
	2. I WAS WRONG- The Real Secret to Productivity (puts a question in the viewer mind what is the secret to producity?)
1. Don't Describe the content of the video
	It does not really matter what the video is about, You want to intrigue the users, the title does that have to be 100% true, but the video content should leave the user satisfied and not feel that their time was wasted
	**How I 100x my productivity** vs 10 tips to be more productive
4. Optimize for humans
	The algorithm follows the preferences of people, people don't follow the algorithm
	Why I spent $29,000 on Apple Products this Year
	8 Habits That made be a millionare
5. A/B Testing
