## Ditch Your To-Do List and Do This Instead

"The calendar is the to-do list."

That's a very interesting point. It makes me think of how, when I was in college, I never felt particularly stressed about getting all of my work done, even though I didn't have an elaborate time-management system in place. However, once I entered the workforce, I began to feel much more stressed about getting all of my work done, even though it's not a particularly large amount of work. I always chalked this difference up to the fact that the stakes are higher in the workplace than they are in the classroom. If I forget to do an assignment, I get an average grade. If I forget to do my work, I get fired.


Now, after listening to this, I think it was relatively easy to manage my school assignments because I simply followed the syllabus for each class--the calendar was the to-do list. The syllabus lists every assignment for the class and when each is due, and I had a pretty good sense of how long it would take me to read a chapter of the textbook or solve a problem set or write a paper. So I never needed a time-management system for school because I could just look at the syllabus, see when a task needed to be done by, estimate how long it would take, and block off some time to do it in my mind.

️ Replace your long to-do list with scheduled calendar tasks.

**It's easier to pull tasks forward than deal with a cascading scheduling problem.**

 Slack in your schedule is essential for effective operations.

Skip the to-do list and schedule tasks directly in your calendar.

Avoid using your email as a to-do list; schedule email tasks.
