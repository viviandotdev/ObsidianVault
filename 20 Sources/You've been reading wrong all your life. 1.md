**Blueprint, read the summary, to build the skeleton to get the main idea of each section.**

Read, the book looking for the most important ideas. Don't read everything, many books have a lot of fluff and repeating ideas.

**Read the book like a choose your own adventure. Read to the section you find most interesting/relevant** or the section that just answers your question you are curious about. There should be a question in your head, what and why are you reading this book for?

**The 3-Step Framework:**
1. **Prep:** Clearly define the purpose of reading and have a goal in mind. Pre-read to build the skeleton
2. **Active Reading:** Use a mental map as a guide and focus on essential information.
   - **The Collector:** who passively absorbs words.
   - **The Curator:** who actively discriminates valuable information- Try to read like an editor of the book
   - **The Connector:** who integrates the new knowledge into long-term memory.
3. **Application:** After reading immediately engage with the information to create and strengthen brain connections

**Always have a question and explain to yourself why you are reading this book** so you know what to look for in the book and ignore anything that is uninteresting.
