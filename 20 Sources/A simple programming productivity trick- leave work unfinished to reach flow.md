## A simple programming productivity trick- leave work unfinished to reach flow

In order to stay in flow, work up to the point where you know what to do next. This is known as the "sticking point", you want to stop right before a task that you know the steps do to complete it.
	This method is effective because it helps fight procrastination, one of the main reasons people procrastinate is uncertainty and lack of clarity about a task. [[Why do we procrastinate]].
	I often stop working when I get stuck or don't know how to solve a problem, this is bad point to stop because it will make it much more difficult to get started on the task again because of the lack of clarity in how to solve the problem
