## I Hate Memorising, so I Created a System to Remember Everything

The way we are taught new things is through **over processed materials** such as lecture slides or even text books some times, where the author are already structured the information in a certain way. However we have no idea why this information is structured this way so we just memorize it as fact.

The process of learning is through **connecting the information** to concept and things you already know and building up from there.
**Finding the pieces that are relevant to you in the sea of information and structuring it it in a way that makes sense to you is the learning process**
Using the information you already know to figure out what is important what what you need to know. Through this active learning you are **making connections between the know and unknown.**

**Protocol for Learning a Topic**
System Design and Neural Networks
Create page in your notability  for a topic you want to learn
One side will be quick notes and unstructured information, this is quick notes you take down when watching a video, of important ideas that helped you understand something
Later go into detail and restructure the notes in a clear way
On the initial digestion on the information don't focus on structuring it, it can be overwhelming to try and structure the information as you are learning, first just focus on understanding.
then later the next day or some time during the week you can work on structuring the information.
Create 2 pages
One for free notes
One for structured notes


How does this fit in with what already know

How do I need to change what I already know to make this fit in?

Why are these connections are being made and why the information is structured the way it is
