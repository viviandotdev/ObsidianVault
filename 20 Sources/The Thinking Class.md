## Highlights
- We are not worried about “humanity” in the abstract. We are worried about the collapse of a premium. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfrh7w18m3rg009d0yj5z9aq))
- AI cannot be the nurse. Not because the nurse is “more human”, but because the nurse’s cognition is entangled with bodies, accountability, trust, and a world that doesn’t politely become text. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfrh98szzgzdfsjyr190mrrc))

- What if AI can do so much of our work because a lot of our work was never as special as we believed? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfrhags5qrwd3chenqbcrnfh))
- Maybe it revealed something more mundane and more humiliating: that a large portion of what we sold as thinking was an institutionalised form of patterning all along. That much of what we called creativity was recombination. That much of what we called insight was retrieval plus framing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfrhbk322ny0d28m7xhabq68))

- And maybe the question isn’t “Can AI do our jobs?” but “Did our jobs ever fully capture what mattered about thought?”
