## 2HW-How to outline your newsletter

### **Step 1: Ideation & Content Generation**

Begin by gathering potential topics and angles for your newsletter.

* **Review High-Performing Short-Form Content:** Look at your most engaging tweets, social media posts, or short videos. These indicate what already resonates with your audience and can be expanded upon.
* **Quick Capture:** Keep a running log of quick thoughts, observations, and initial ideas as they come to you. Use a note-taking app, a physical notebook, or a voice recorder.

### **Step 2: Research**

Once you have a general idea, delve deeper to enrich your content.

* **Gather Supporting Material:** Collect relevant tweets, quotes, insights from books, articles, or even personal anecdotes. These will provide inspiration and help you back up your arguments with credible sources.

### **Step 3: Planning**

Before you write, define the core elements of your newsletter. This is where you establish your purpose and target audience.

* **Who Are You Writing For?** Understand your ideal reader's needs, challenges, and interests.
* **Topic:** Clearly state the main subject of this specific newsletter.
* **Perspective:** What unique angle or viewpoint will you bring to the topic?
* **Your Goals:** What do you want your readers to feel, learn, or do after reading your newsletter?
* **Common Problems:** What struggles related to your topic are your readers facing?
* **Objections:** What doubts or counter-arguments might your readers have? Address these proactively.
* **Benefits:** How will your advice or insights improve your readers' lives?
* **Personal Experiences:** Share relevant stories or lessons learned to build connection and trust.
* **Outline Steps & Frameworks:** If applicable, break down complex ideas into actionable steps or easy-to-follow frameworks.
* **Develop a "Big Idea":** Can you summarize the core concept of your newsletter in one compelling sentence? This becomes your central theme.
* **Visualize:** Think about how you might represent your main idea visuallyâ€”through an image, diagram, or mental model.

### **Step 4: Structuring Your Newsletter (Key Points & Outline)**

Now, organize your ideas into a cohesive flow, often using a persuasive writing framework.

* **Choose a Persuasive Writing Framework:** Popular options include APAG, PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve), AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action), PASTOR, or STAR. These frameworks provide a roadmap for engaging your reader.
    * **Attention:** Open with an intriguing fact, a captivating story, a thought-provoking question, or a bold statement to immediately grab your reader's interest and open a "curiosity loop."
    * **Lead/Problem:** Introduce a significant problem your audience faces. Agitate that problem by describing its impact, and then present your unique perspective or solution.
    * **Body:** This is where you deliver the core value. Explain how to overcome the problem, elaborate on the benefits of your solution, and provide the "why" behind those benefits. Use examples, data, and actionable advice.
    * **Conclusion:** Wrap up your main points, recap what the reader has learned, and provide a lasting piece of value or thought.
    * **Call to Action (CTA):** Clearly tell your readers what you want them to do next. This could be to reply to the email, visit a link, share the newsletter, or check out a product/service.

* **Create Your Outline:** Based on your chosen framework, sketch out the main sections:
    * **Introduction:** Hook, problem, and your unique angle.
    * **Body Paragraphs (2-4+):** Each paragraph or section should cover a specific point, solution, or benefit.
    * **Conclusion:** Summary, final thought, and call to action.

### **Step 5: Writing & Editing**

With your detailed outline in hand, the writing process becomes much smoother.

* **Write the Newsletter:** Follow your outline, fleshing out each section with compelling prose and clear explanations.
* **Edit & Refine:**
    * Check for clarity, conciseness, and flow.
    * Proofread for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.
    * Ensure your tone is consistent and engaging.
    * Read it aloud to catch awkward phrasing.
