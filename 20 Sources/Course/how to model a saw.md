# How to model a Saw


How to Create a Saw
Creating the Handle:
1. Create a cube.
2. Scale the cube to form a rectangle.
3. Extrude and scale the rectangle to match the desired shape of the handle.
4. Bridge the edge loops to connect the extruded parts:
   a. Remove the faces.
   b. Select the edges of each part.
   c. Connect the selected edges.
5. Add a Subdivision Surface modifier.
6. Sharpen the edges.
7. Add loop cuts and adjust them to refine the handle's shape.

Creating the Finger Holes:
1. Create a cylinder.
2. Position the cylinder on the handle to form the finger holes.

Creating the Saw Blade:
1. Create a cube.
2. Scale the cube to form the base shape of the saw blade.
3. Add 21 loop cuts to the blade.
4. Select every other vertex along the edge of the blade.
5. Move the selected vertices to create the saw teeth pattern.
6. Add a Bevel modifier to the saw blade to give the teeth a more realistic shape.

Additional Tips:
- Adjust the dimensions and proportions of the handle, finger holes, and saw blade to match your desired saw design.
- Use additional loop cuts, edge creases, or the Bevel modifier to refine the shapes and add more details to the saw.
- Experiment with different materials and textures to give the saw a realistic appearance.
- Consider adding a wooden texture or material to the handle for a more authentic look.

By following these steps and using the various modeling tools and modifiers in Blender, you can create a detailed and realistic saw model. Remember to take your time, pay attention to the proportions and details, and make adjustments as needed to achieve the desired result.
