# How to model a Shovel

1. Import the reference image.
2. Press Shift + A to add a new mesh.
3. Create a cylinder for the shovel rod:
   a. Right-click on the cylinder and select "Shade Smooth".
4. Add a Bevel modifier to the cylinder to fix the smooth top.
5. Enter Edit Mode to make the rod longer.
6. Apply a Subdivision Surface modifier to the rod.
7. Duplicate the rod and scale it to create the shovel handle.
8. Move the handle to the bottom of the rod.

Creating the Shovel Blade:
1. Create a cube.
2. Adjust the faces to make the cube thinner.
3. Select the bottom face of the cube and extrude it downwards.
4. Make a loop cut in the vertical middle and move it backwards.
5. Select the two middle vertices and pull them down to create the tip of the blade.
6. Center all the vertices and set their X-coordinate to 0.
7. Add a Subdivision Surface modifier to soften the shape of the blade.
   a. Add loop cuts to sharpen the edges.
8. Select the back vertices of the blade and pull them to refine the shape.

Additional Tips:
- Adjust the dimensions and proportions of the shovel rod, handle, and blade to match your desired shovel design.
- Use additional loop cuts, edge creases, or the Bevel modifier to refine the shapes and add more details to the shovel.
- Experiment with different materials and textures to give the shovel a realistic appearance.
- Consider adding a wooden texture or material to the handle for a more authentic look.

By following these steps and utilizing the various modeling tools and modifiers in Blender, you can create a detailed and realistic shovel model. Take your time, pay attention to the proportions and details, and make adjustments as needed to achieve the desired result.
