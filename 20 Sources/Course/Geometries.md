Geometries are composed of vertices and faces.

- [BoxGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry) To create a box.
	-  `width`: The size on the `x` axis
	- `height`: The size on the `y` axis
	- `depth`: The size on the `z` axis
	- `widthSegments`: How many subdivisions in the `x` axis
	- `heightSegments`: How many subdivisions in the `y` axis
	- `depthSegments`: How many subdivisions in the `z` axis
- [PlaneGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/PlaneGeometry) To create a rectangle plane.
- [CircleGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/CircleGeometry) To create a disc or a portion of a disc (like a pie chart).
- [ConeGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/ConeGeometry) To create a cone or a portion of a cone. You can open or close the base of the cone.
- [CylinderGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/CylinderGeometry) To create a cylinder. You can open or close the ends of the cylinder and you can change the radius of each end.
- [RingGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/RingGeometry) To create a flat ring or portion of a flat circle.
- [TorusGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/TorusGeometry) To create a ring that has a thickness (like a donut) or portion of a ring.
- [TorusKnotGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/TorusKnotGeometry) To create some sort of knot geometry.
- [DodecahedronGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/DodecahedronGeometry) To create a 12 faces sphere. You can add details for a rounder sphere.
- [OctahedronGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/OctahedronGeometry) To create a 8 faces sphere. You can add details for a rounder sphere.
- [TetrahedronGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/TetrahedronGeometry) To create a 4 faces sphere (it won't be much of a sphere if you don't increase details). You can add details for a rounder sphere.
- [IcosahedronGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/IcosahedronGeometry) To create a sphere composed of triangles that have roughly the same size.
- [SphereGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/SphereGeometry) To create the most popular type of sphere where faces looks like quads (quads are just a combination of two triangles).
- [ShapeGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/ShapeGeometry) To create a shape based on a path.
- [TubeGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/TubeGeometry) To create a tube following a path.
- [ExtrudeGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/ExtrudeGeometry) To create an extrusion based on a path. You can add and control the bevel.
- [LatheGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/LatheGeometry) To create a vase or portion of a vase (more like a revolution).
- [TextGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=textge#examples/en/geometries/TextGeometry) To create a 3D text. You'll have to provide the font in typeface json format.
### Creating your own buffer geometry
To create your own buffer geometry, start by instantiating an empty [BufferGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/BufferGeometry). We will create a simple triangle:

```javascript
// Create an empty BufferGeometry
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry()

// Create a Float32Array containing the vertices position (3 by 3)
const positionsArray = new Float32Array([
    0, 0, 0, // First vertex
    0, 1, 0, // Second vertex
    1, 0, 0  // Third vertex
])

// Create the attribute and name it 'position'
const positionsAttribute = new THREE.BufferAttribute(positionsArray, 3)
geometry.setAttribute('position', positionsAttribute)
```
