> Take the podcast survey here (it take 5mins!) üëâ https://forms.gle/NbDdToDNgpHUMzcP9¬†<br/>>   üìù Fill in the podcast survey here (it takes 5mins!)  https://forms.gle/NbDdToDNgpHUMzcP9  <br/>>  Picture this: you're sitting at your desk, ready to conquer that important task that you‚Äôve been meaning to get around. But somehow you find ourself falling into the rabbit hole of Youtube videos or with a sudden urge to clean your house. Yep, we‚Äôve all been caught by that monster of procrastination. Although procrastination is such a common problem, we still have lots of misperceptions about it. We tend to think that procrastination is a time-management issue. But - as we‚Äôll learn in today‚Äôs episode - procrastination is actually a little more complex. By understanding the psychology nature of what procrastination is and why we procrastinate, we might be in a better place to reduce or even overcome procrastination. My guest today is Dr. Fuschia Sirois, professor of psychology at Durham University. Before she came to the UK, Fuschia was a Canada Research Chair and the Co-ordinator of the multidisciplinary Psychological Health and Well-being Research cluster at Bishop‚Äôs University (2010-2015). Dr Fuschia's interest stretch from self-regulation ‚Äî exploring how we manage our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors ‚Äî to their impact on our health and wellbeing. Above all, Dr Fuschia is probably most well-known for her work on procrastination. Her recent book explores what procrastination is, why we procrastinate, and what we can do about it. What I really admire about about Fuschia is that she believes in the power of psychological science as a tool to improve lives, and she has an uncanny ability to communicate these complex ideas in a way that is both engaging and easily comprehensible. Her work's been features in many news outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the BBC.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I think it can be a full range. And often it's a complex range. And some of the research that one of my former PhD students did also suggested it can sometimes be mixed. Sometimes we can be both excited about a task and kind of like, oh, I can't wait to do this and really prove myself. And at the same time, fearful or anxious or nervous about that task. And depending on how we manage that balance, you know, and I think one of the things that some of the research has shown that people who are prone to procrastination are more sensitive To those negative emotions. Areas in the brain, the amygdala, which is sort of the threat detection center, right? That area of the brain is qualitatively different in people who are prone to procrastination versus those that are not suggesting against a sensitivity to negative stimuli. And that includes the negative emotions that they have around a task.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I definitely want to talk more about this emotion stuff. To what extent is uncertainty or a lack of clarity about the goal or the task? To what extent does that come into it? Because that strikes me slightly different to the emotion stuff.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>No, actually it's linked right into it. Yeah, good one. I was going to get to that. Thank you. No, yeah. So I mean, so think about it, right? Do you have a task that's not well structured? It's uncertain. What do you feel?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Uncertainty, anxiety, stress. Yeah, like I'm not really sure what they want. I'm not really sure. It's a big mountain. It's like study chemistry. What a study chemistry. Oh, it's the book's too big. It's emotions. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, it's not just thoughts, right? So we can think about things in a way that trigger the emotions, it's not necessarily that the emotions are coming first, but the way we think about a task, or even the way a task is laid Out to us.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>No, I'm not. I'm plunging away. I'm pulsating. I told the grapes. I haven't had a grape in a while. There you go.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But you know, so, so we think of that as being undisciplined, right? Or poor self-control. And, you know, there's some, you know, some researchers has just that, you know, all procrastination is just impulsivity. Well, being impulsive doesn't cause you to procrastinate because if that was too, procrastinate on even things that were fun. Yeah, true. Right? So what impulsivity does with layers over, you've got this task that's difficult, you're struggling with the emotions, you don't know how to manage them. Instead of staying focused on how can I manage these emotions? If you're more impulsive, you're going to be more easily distracted by things within the environment that will offer you a quick emotional fix. Right? And that's where the impulsivity comes in. So it facilitates just as digital distractions and so many other things in the environment do. It facilitates procrastination, but does not cause it, for say.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>An image that's coming to my mind is that it's, if emotions are ground zero for procrastination, it's almost like the emotions are sort of the hump we have to get over to get started with A task. That's right. And for some people, their level of discipline is, or their level of self-control is higher than that hump.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah. That's a cool way to visualize it, I think. I mean, and that's just it. If you've got that greater degree of self-control, you can sit with those emotions and work through them and struggle through them because you're not going to be wanting to just avoid, Right? Self-control helps reduce the tendency to avoid things, including those negative emotional experiences and focuses you in on, okay, what do I need to do to manage these emotions? Right? So it also helps you kind of say, here's the problem I need to solve, right? And it's still problem, doesn't make the problem go away. And again, it could be as simple as, oh, I've just got to look at this task this way and find a meaningful thing about, oh, if I rearrange this task this way, it's actually not that stressful Overall. The other thing that can happen though, too, and this is going back to the ground series emotions. And I think it's a really good example of it is often we procrastinate, not because of the emotions we're experiencing right now with that task. They might actually be fairly manageable. But because of the emotions that we imagine that we're going to experience once we start engaging with the task. So, okay, yeah.</blockquote>

Like don't do anything that's going to generate more negative emotions or throw more layers of negative difficult emotions onto something that you're already procrastinating because You've got difficult emotions in there in the first place, right? So a couple key strategies, and again, it depends on whether you've already procrastinated or if you're struggling with a task, right? So if you're struggling with a task, you would say that self compassion is an effective strategy. And that's basically recognizing that, you know, to struggle with things as part of a learning process as part of being human, not getting it right on the first time, you know, and that's Often people we start things and then they realize, oh, it's not going the way I planned, right?
