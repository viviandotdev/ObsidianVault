## Joy of React

The truly magical thing about React is that **we don't have to worry about keeping our state (held in JavaScript) and our UI (in theÂ DOM?) in sync.**

With React, we're **describing what we want the UI to be, based on the current application state.** React takes those descriptions and makes it real.
