## You need 3 hobbies, one that keeps you healthy, one that earns you money and one to be creative 


- Society wants us to specialize into one thing, however that is not always the best way to do things, 

- i think i was the least happy when I didn't have any hobbies. i just focused on the school  made it my entire identity. Having no hobbies also meant I had nothing to talk about with other people which i think made be really shy and insecure.

- having multiple hobbies and actually working on them
	- one that keeps you healthy - rock climbing
	- one that earns you money - coding
	- one that keeps your learning - reading / writing (obsidian) (language studies?)
	- one that is creative  - drawing
