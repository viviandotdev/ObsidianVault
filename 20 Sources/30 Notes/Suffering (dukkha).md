## Suffering (dukkha)
The second mark of existence is
Don't accept the bad things that happen to do, accept that bad things will happen to you.
Suffering is inevitable, so we should be aware and know that it will come so that when it actually comes it won't be so bad.
For example next time you experience suffering instead of thinking, why is this happening to me?, tell your self that I was aware that this could happen and that I am not alone in experiencing this.
Life will be easier if we learn to embrace suffering instead of always trying to avoid it.
