# just exist bro

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZkjFXQnPdg&list=LL&index=3)  

- all you need to do to live
- everything that needs to happen in your life it will happen?
- just keep going, life is spiral, if you miss an opportunity it will come back in the cycle
- you can just be, you don't always have to be doing things all the time,
- being mindset, do things because you want to instead of feeling you must do it.
- it is peaceful knowing that all i need to do is exist and be open to anything
- train yourself to have an empty mind
