Focus on the challenge, and not its byproducts.


**This is where we get ambition right. It's when we're driven from a point of self-awareness, understanding that we want to do the best we can with this mind and body we've been gifted.** While we can be appreciative of everything we have, it's important that we acknowledge how we could better direct our thoughts to solving the problems we care about most.


**But where ambition goes wrong, however, is when we thirst for the byproducts of that ambition.** When the promotion becomes more important than the work, when the money is more desirable than the challenge, and so on. This is when you've commoditized your ambition, rather than using it as a gateway to knowing yourself.

*Ambition doing the best with the mind and body you are given.*
*I'm ambitious not in the pursuit of money or success but in the self actualization* 

**Ambition is a tricky thing because it's both empowering and pointless.**

**I've thought about this quite a bit, especially because I consider myself an ambitious person. Not in the pursuit of status or recognition, but more so in the [[self actualization|actualization]] of what I'm capable of.**


*Self actualization is true ambition,*
*Most people think of ambition as chasing success but in my definition I am ambitions in the actualization of what I am capable*
*I want to use the brain and body the best of my ability and become the person that I want to and know that I can be.*
I consider myself ambitions in the sense that I want to see what I am capable of given the mind and body I was born with


**If you want a certain state to persist, you will no longer have an ambition to accumulate, but rather an ambition to preserve.**
