## Episode AI notes


1. Money is a tool and it is best to make the most of it during one's lifetime. **The idea is to aim to die with zero in the bank account by using money for experiences, giving it to children, and donating to charities**. People who claim to enjoy their work and make money from it are similar to addicts who claim to enjoy their substances. Most people stumble into their jobs by accident and it is unlikely that it aligns perfectly with their true passions. Rich people who continue to work solely for the sake of money are considered foolish by the speaker and other billionaires.
2. **When in doubt, make a list of things that you would have wanted to know**. Online courses are structured in a list format with modules and lessons. **Listicles are a helpful tool for organizing thoughts. Making a list can help with feeling overwhelmed. Numbered lists force organization in a sensible way.**
3. **Arriving at a goal can feel like a strange experience and prompt introspection about the next steps**. Meeting the version of yourself that has achieved success can be like meeting a stranger. Transitioning from scarcity to abundance mindset is a significant change. Developing a relationship with the new version of yourself takes time. The internal identity tends to lag behind the external reality by about two years.
4.  How to come up with content ideas?
	 What is the list of things if you were talking to yourself from two years ago? What is three or five or seven? What we like, we like odd numbers. Three or five or seven things you would have wanted to know. And then just talk about those things. And that's it. An online course is a list

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Look, I guess, so there's a guy who I spent a bit of time with called Bill Perkins. He is a ridiculously rich guy. He's written a book called to die with zero. The great book, it's basically about how to make the most from your money in your life. And it's kind of whole thesis is that fundamentally money is a tool. And you should therefore aim to die with zero in the back account, kind of thing. So, you know, cash in the money for experiences when you're young, give the money away to your kids when they're younger and they actually can use it, not when they're 68 on average, give The money away to charities because people are dying right now, not on your deathbed, all of those things. And I kind of asked him that like, you know, what about the people who say that they enjoy their work and the work just happens to bring the money. And his point was that like, well, you know, a heroin addict says that they enjoy heroin, a crack head claims to enjoy crack. Yeah. And what are the chances that like, the thing that you would genuinely do if you had, if you could do whatever you wanted, just happens to be the thing that you stumbled into, because most People stumbled into their jobs from like various accidents. Like, what are the chances? Come on, have a bit more imagination. And he was saying that like, he's at least like a billionaire and knows all loads of other billionaires. It was like rich people are the other dumbest people because they continue to work for this tool, because at some point it stopped becoming about the fulfillment that the money could Buy them and became more about chasing the money for its own sake. And they convinced themselves that that's actually, that's actually fun. Yeah.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And so this is something that we say to our students in the YouTube Academy. When in doubt, just think about list. Just like, what is the list of things if you were talking to yourself from two years ago? What is three or five or seven? What we like, we like odd numbers. Three or five or seven things you would have wanted to know. And then just talk about those things. And that's it. An online course is a list. Three to five modules. Each lesson has, each module has like three-ish lessons in it. The first one is about the philosophy and the overview. The second one is about the step-by-step method. The third one is about like, do's and don'ts. You've got an online course. The listicle.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>Everything is a listicle at the end of the day. So we lean very heavily into listicles. That's good. I like that. That's good. I helps you organize your thoughts. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>So good. Totally. And then for the audience, you have to get to the end. Yeah. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>Let me know retention curves are still like good. Okay. You don't have to get to the usual ones. Yeah. Yeah. But that is interesting.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Because I find that actually to be just good advice in general. Like if there's anything, whenever I feel overwhelmed, I make a list. That's just like what I do. Or like if we have a video project and I'm like, how's it going to get done? I write steps, which is a list. Yeah. What a fascinating thing. I wonder why does a human mind work like that? Just because it's like algorithmic almost of like first this, then that. Or if this, then that. And then this, then that. I don't know.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's basically things in a, like the reason I like numbered lists, rather than bullet points, is because the numbered list forces you to organize it in a sensible way.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Which is actually a strange experience. Right. It's a strange experience to like, I find that at any given point in my entrepreneurial journey, I've been either in pursuit of something or constantly been in pursuit of something. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then when you arrive at something that felt like a ridiculous pursuit, like it wasn't going to happen, it's almost like this reestablishment of like, is the pursuit over? Have I arrived? Is it now time to be present or is it time to develop a new pursuit?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>And am I working to maintain? Yeah. Or am I working to grow something new? Nice. Yeah. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And I got to speak to a business coach who's kind of like a life coach, great guy, who put it into context for me of like, having arrived at this moment is like meeting a new version of yourself. And that's like meeting a stranger. So like prior to this, there was like a scarcity mindset of not having things. It didn't have opportunities, revenue, viewership, didn't have the things. Mm. When you arrive to the place where you do have those things, you're now in an abundant mindset or you're living in abundance, right? And you're now meeting a new version of yourself, the abundant version. And that is like developing a relationship with a stranger and will take the same amount of time to meet this new version of yourself.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>There's a quote I heard recently, which is, your internal identity lags about two years behind your external reality.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>100%. Yeah, dude. 100%.</blockquote>
