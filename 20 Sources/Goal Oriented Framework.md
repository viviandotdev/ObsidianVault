## Goal Oriented Framework

>Due to the nature of the dopamine system, mentally logging your behaviors into a goal-oriented framework allows you to derive much more satisfaction from life. Simply put, when you identify your actions as moving you closer to a goal, it’s satisfying and pleasurable. The more important the goal, the more satisfaction.
