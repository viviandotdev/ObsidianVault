### an EASY guide to SEASONING CARBON STEEL pans (2 METHODS) - YouTube

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAxFmZXGcKY)

- heat up the pan, make sure they pan is dry before you oil it
- then oil the pan both inside and out side 
- heat the pan with the oil to it's smoke point
	- when the oil reaches the **smoke point** the fat molecules break down and reorganize
		-  [Template:Smoke point of cooking oils - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Smoke_point_of_cooking_oils)
	- the form long polymer chains that bond directly to the metal surface, creating a thin plastic-like coating that's chemically bonded to the pan.
	- the polymerized oil fills in the microscopic pres and rough spots in the metal therefore creating a smooth slippery surface that the food does no stick to.
- you can repeat the process to create multiple seasoning layers, which builds upon the previous creating a smother surface over time
