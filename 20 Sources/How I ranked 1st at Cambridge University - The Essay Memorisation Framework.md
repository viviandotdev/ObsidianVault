### How I ranked 1st at Cambridge University - The Essay Memorisation Framework




Essay Creation and Structure
🖊️
The "Essay Memorization Framework" consists of two stages: the creation stage and the memorization stage, designed to produce first-class essay plans for every possible exam question.

📝
Essay plans are structured with an intro, preamble, subheadings, evidence, and numbered key points to demonstrate a clear structure to examiners.

Research and Content Generation
🔍
The author uses Google to find answers, often linking to review articles and papers, creating a research document by rephrasing relevant information in their own words.

🧠
Content blocks and comprehensive essay plans covering the entire syllabus enable the author to predict essay titles and generate first-class essays from scratch if unfamiliar with the topic.

Memorization Techniques
📚
The author memorizes every paragraph in each essay plan using Anki flashcards, which may seem excessive but proved effective.

🕸️
Spider diagrams are utilized to memorize entire essays, providing a visual representation of the content structure.

Revision Strategy
⏰
A retrospective revision timetable is employed to systematically implement active recall and spaced repetition for effective review and memorization of essay plans.

🏆
This framework helped the author memorize 50 essay plans, enabling them to efficiently regurgitate information during exams and win the top exam results prize at Cambridge University.
