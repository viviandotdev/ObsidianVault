## You've been reading wrong all your life.

Blueprint, read the summary, to build the skeleton to get the main idea of each section.
Read, the book looking for the most important ideas
Don't read everything, many books have a lot of fluff and repeating ideas.

Read the book like a choose your own adventure. **Read to the section** you find most interesting/relevant or the section that just answers your question you are curious about. There should be a question in your head, what and why are you reading this book for?

Active reading exercises involve reviewing new concepts, challenging ideas, and being able to convey the information as if teaching it to ensure understanding and retention.

### The 3-Step Framework for this method includes
1. Prep: Clearly define the purpose of reading and have a goal in mind. Pre-read to build the skeleton
2. Active Reading: Use a mental map as a guide and focus on essential information.
	(3 Mental Voices while reading) (Put chapter highlights and notes into one page)â€™
	The method involves three mental voices dubbed "The Trio":
	1. The Collector, who passively absorbs words.
	2. The Curator, who actively discriminates valuable information- Try to read like an editor of the book, you can skim the book and skip the fluff and read the most important parts multiple times.
	3. The Connector, who integrates the new knowledge into long-term memory.
		1. The Review- ask yourself if the concept is new to you and is it relevant to the question your are asking
		2. The Debate- do you agree with the concept, what problems are there with it, Think about different perspective.
2. Application: After reading Immediately engage with the information to create and strengthen brain connections, think about experiments you can try to actually apply what you have learning into your own life.
	1. 3. The Professor- can you turn this concept into. Ted talk, what concepts from your life can you relate this to and can you teach it to a 5th grader (talk about it, write about it, strength)
	2. Future you- how does this information make your life better, now you know this information how will you change?


How will i apply this information?
For each book you are reading create an ongoing note in obsidian, broken up into the chapter structures of the book and write notes for each chapter
Always have a question and explain to yourself why you are reading this book so you know what to look for in the book and ignore anything that is unintersting
Put the highlights below that
