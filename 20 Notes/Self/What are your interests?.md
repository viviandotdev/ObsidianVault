***Work is a necessary part of modern life. It would be foolish to not pursue something that you are passionate about. Why would you want to spend 40-70% of your life doing something you hate?***
# Interest Exploration

*Write out 20 interests that you have some form of interest in. If you had an entire month to yourself, what would you want to learn more about? This can be broad or specific. If you have experience with the interest, be specific with certain parts you want to learn. If you are new to the interest, go broad and put emphasis on the basics and principles.*
