Anatta refers the [[Impermanence (anicca)|impermanence]] of the self or soul. Belief in the permanent self creates boundaries between the "self" and others. Realizing there is no isolated, unchanging self creates a sense of interconnectedness with all living beings. This blurs the distinctions between "self" and "others" creating more harmonious relationships with reduced conflicts.
