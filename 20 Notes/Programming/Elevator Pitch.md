My name is Vivian Lin. In my current role as a Lead QA Automation Engineer at Cigna, I leverage my strong development skills to create robust E2E test scripts with Cypress and WebdriverIO, achieving 100% test coverage on critical user flows.

I have also mentored new team members on testing methodologies and facilitating cross-functional collaboration between QA and product teams to identify and resolve potential defects early in the development cycle.

Before this, I gained hands-on experience as an Application Developer at Cigna, where I developed and delivered features within a micro-frontend architecture using React, React Native, and TypeScript. I collaborated closely with designers and product owners to ensure high-quality, maintainable code and successfully resolved over 50 product defects, significantly improving product stability and user experience.

During my internship at HBO Max, I contributed to frontend development by designing, testing, and deploying new UI components to production using JavaScript, Node.js, React, and Drupal. I worked on a responsive UI component that improved page discoverability and increased application sign-ups by 15%, while also authoring technical specifications and participating in agile development cycles.


In college, I took ownership of an end-to-end project as a research assistant, where I managed a team of five developers to build a biomedical sensor app with Flutter and Firebase.

I am now looking to apply this unique blend of development, quality assurance, and team leadership to a challenging full-time software engineering role. I'm particularly interested in roles at [Company Name] because [mention a specific company value, project, or mission]. I'm confident my ability to build and rigorously test high-quality software would allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team.
