[[Life Reflections]]

**What moments or experiences defined 2025 for me?**
	I built consistency with climbing
	Started actually working as QA Automation Engineer, first year i actually felt i was working the first two years i was just coasting and getting by without doing much
**Areas**
==**health**==
- Gained some weight this year i would like to shed.
	- what caused this?
		- I was busy for a good chunk of this year with work, the oneview project was stressful not because i felt stressed but because other people were pushing their stress on to me.
		- When i climbed hard i would do nothing the next day which led to some weight gain, i also feel stronger so there is muscle as well
			==improve== To fix this I will try to practice some calisthenics on my days off.
==**work**==
- **Did not work much on my personal projects this year**, however i did work more and I learned a lot about the process of building software and will apply these to my own projects
	==improve== - focus less on work, optimize your work and spend more time on personal projects 
==**relationships**==
- made some friends this year from climbing, josephine, zach, kaitlyn and raph
	- went on an outdoor climbing trip and few hikes, they were fun and I would like to do more of them this year in the spring/fall, rock scrambles were fun
	==**maintain**== work on maintaining your relationships 

**Improvements/Experiments to try this year**
- i want to be more intentional with my time this year, i will try time tracking to see how it works 
	- each time you will do something it should be for 90 minutes, no more doing too many things at once
- calisthenics on your no climbing days, work on calisthenics, everyday in the morning after coffe you should get a light workout in without fail
- use your walking pad when mom is not home for easy tasks
- simplify your process for the things you want to do more of.
- keep a habit tracker journal for this year
- do weekly reflections, just think in days and weeks, do your best we cannot comprehend such long timelines, it is waste of time to plan for duch as long horizon, there is so much you can do within a day so just focus on that 
- 

**Goals this year**
- Lose 10 pounds
- Learn the handstand / bridge
- Share your personal project
