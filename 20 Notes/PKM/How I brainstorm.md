**Checklist**
- [ ] Fill out topic
- [ ] Fill out references
- [ ] Fill out braindump
- [ ] Think on a structure for how you can organize the brainstormed ideas conceptually
- [ ] Move the brainstormed items into the structure
- [ ] Turn it into new notes or intended outputs


### Ideation
First, we look for existing Brainstorms > References we already have to use as inspiration for the work.

There are five ways you can look for notes, which are highlighted in Retrieving information from your notes

### Fill out brain dump (how)
**From previous ideas**
First, we need to extract the ideas in the notes we just found from going through our Brainstorms > References

Whenever you come across something that can be useful, just make a bullet point under either linking to the section or with the copy pasted idea you want to use.

**From current ideas**
Now that we have a foundation through our past work, we can use it as inspiration to bring out the ideas in our current mind.

**Prompts**
Can use callouts for different prompts or structures you can add to your draft, inspired by Kortex workflow.

### Organizing Ideas
Now, from your ideas, we can start coming up with paragraphs or groups in Brainstorms > Organized Ideas:

Are there any emerging patterns or bigger themes that these ideas indicate?
When importing quotes, we can choose to directly quote it or to paraphrase to better fit our writing
For our existing ideas we can rephrase the relevant parts
For previous creations we can choose to reference the video for further details or to only resurface what is relevant
To help with structure, we can look at My writing frameworks

### Potential Outputs
Now that we've finished our thinking, it's time to choose how we use it.

If this brainstorm was for making a new blog post, we can create a blog note and revise it a bit to be ready for publish.

But once we are finished, it's best we preserve these ideas for nurturing by integrating them into the rest of our notes. This can be done through Evergreen Notes.
