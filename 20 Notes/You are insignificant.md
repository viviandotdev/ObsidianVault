- If they are interesting enough to you will work on them for a long period of time and get good at them anyway
- Create your work because you want to and that's it don't do it for anyone else but yourself and to see what you are capable of
- If what you are capable of is not good enough to receive recognition for it that's okay because it all doesn't matter any way. We are all here for a brief period of time.
- It is enough to just be you.
- It is enough to just be kind.
- I am ambitious not in the way of success or money I am ambitious in the way that I am curious in the actualization of what I am capable.
- do things just because you can and not for any other reason
