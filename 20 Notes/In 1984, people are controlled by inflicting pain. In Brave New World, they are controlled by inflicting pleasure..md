Orwell was worried about a world where freedom is taken away by force, where books might be banned, and truth is hidden from us. He feared a world where we are controlled by making us afraid.

 **He imagined a world where no one needed to force us to give up our freedom because we would happily do it ourselves, all for the sake of comfort and fun.**

**In Huxley's future, there's no need to ban books because no one wants to read them anyway. He was scared that we would be given so much information and entertainment that we wouldn't care about anything important anymore.**

In the modern world people spend hours on tik tok being constantly entertained, the literacy rate is currently dropping because kids are not reading. It seems that there is evidence showing that Huxley may have been right.
