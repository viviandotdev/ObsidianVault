Woodpecker method
1. Solve as many exercises from the book as you can in four weeks.
2. Take a short break (the authors recommend between 1 day and 1 week).
3. Solve the same set of exercises you already did, but this time in just two weeks. This shorter timespan becomes possible because you have seen the exercises before, and therefore you can start to rely on your intuition and pattern recognition more than pure calculation.
4. Repeat the process, halving the time you take each cycle. So, your next cycle will see you re-solve the puzzles in one week, then in four days, then in two days, and finally in one day.
5. If it proves impossible to solve the exercise set in these very short timespans, then do your best. Regardless, stop after seven cycles.
6. Move on to a new set of exercises, again solving as many as you can in four weeks and repeat the cyclical process


did something similar to the Woodpecker Method, though this was before I discovered Pump Up Your Rating. I took a set of 1300 beginner puzzles (no more than 3 move combinations in difficulty) and did 50 a day, and repeated that process six or 7 times, which took six or 7 months since 1300 puzzles/ 50 per day = 26 days to complete. My rating jumped from 1200 USCF to 1700 USCF in roughly 15 months IIRC. I did some other study during that time as well, but this tactics training played a big part in my opinion


Also learn a good opening
1000 puzzles 7 times over 127 days

I am doing the 7 circles with CTART 4.0. As you said some are complicated so I’m only doing lvl 10 - 60. You could try that.  
I plan to finish 10-60 then do 60-120, 120 to 180 and then the whole thing 🤯🙈 I will drill them all in my brain. I have noticed great improvement in my calculation and visualization skills. Good
