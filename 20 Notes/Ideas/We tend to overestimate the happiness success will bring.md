**Idea**
Money and success will not give you the happiness you expect it.
We humans adapt quickly will always want more
Reaching the end only a small part the journey is like 99% of it.

**Common Problems/Misconception**
People think that money will buy them happiness and it is want they want should strive for. However it seems that when people get a lot of money that actually feel more lost then ever.


**Experience/Example**
When he became a millionaire he realized he already had all the things that made him happy.
==[[flow]] and peace were the true sources of [[happiness]].==
The goal is to not retire to goal is find activities that bring you flow and surround yourself with people that give you peace.
When people succeed they believe they are done and don’t need to work anymore
However it was work that gave them the feeling of flow which what made them happy.
[[Your don't get happy from achieving your goal, you get happiness from the seeing progress towards your goal]]
[[The day I became a millionaire]]


**Cycle of the rich**
Exotic travel for a year or more before becoming bored of that, then transitioning to getting very fit or some other personal goal. After achieving that goal, buying a boat or some other extravagant hobby purchase, and then finally getting divorced or going through some other personal crisis. If they come back from that, maybe they attempt their own start-up or fund or, most likely, philanthropy.
