- We go to school to get **indoctrinated** on how to contribute and participate as a consumer in this capitalism economy.  [^1]
- In school we are taught to learn that we need to go to work and to go to work we need to **find a job to support your family**
- The end **goal** is to buy a house and support your children:
	- get a job
	- find a romantic partner
	- buy a house with them
	- get married
	- start a family
	- to create children -> more consumers/labor force to support the economy


**Indoctrination** - teach people to accept a set of beliefs uncritically
