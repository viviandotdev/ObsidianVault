**Idea**
It is the progress towards your goals that makes you happy not achieving the goal itself
Therefore you are much close to feeling of happiness than you think because just the act of seeing progress is enough to make you happy
**The end is not what makes you happy it’s process and progress you see that actually makes you happy**

But the happiness is in the journey, if you enjoy what you are doing now that is enough


**Common Problems/Misconception
- We think that we will be happy when we achieve our goals
- However it is the progress towards the goals that makes us happy

**Personal Experience**
- For example when playing minecraft your are **having the most fun when you gather resources and making things**
- When I maxed out all my gear and built everything is needed I actually feel a little empty
