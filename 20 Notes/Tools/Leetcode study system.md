Do these same questions again
Execute Leetcode plan- if it works it works if not it does not
2 months = 3 cycles
I did something similar with fewer puzzles and only went through them 3 times

Part 1 easy
Start with complete all easy questions (37 questions) =   (45 minutes a day)
See how long it takes for you finish and understand all 37 (7.5 minutes of thinking then look at solution)
Completed in x days
Complete in x*0.75 days
Complete in x*0.75 days
(Cycle through easy 3 times) (each time should be faster than before)

Part 2 medium (1/3)
The complete all medium questions (108/35) = 2 question a day   (7 weeks)
108 / 3 ‎ = 36
See how long it takes for you finish and understand all 36 (7.5 minutes of thinking then look at solution)
Completed in x days
Complete in x*0.75 days
Complete in x*0.75 days
(Cycle through easy 3 times) (each time should be faster than before)


**The creation stage** (spend 1 hour a day in this stage starting with your problems list)
- choose leetcode problems to do (done)
- make sure you understand all the problems and all the details (do problems and make sure you fully understand the patterns)
	- i think a pattern a week is good enough plan for now
- make anki flash cards of problems you have solved and understand (small chunks if problem is too long)
	- you should memorize the problem and the solution with it as well,

**The memorization stage** (daily cards)
- anki flash cards
- go through questions
**Revision stage**
- retrospective revision
