-  Show your genuine enthusiasm for the role in the first question
	- When someone asks "How are you?" during an interview, instead of just saying "I'm good, how about you," try:
	- **"I'm doing really well! I'm really excited to speak to you today and learn more about this role.**
- Makes the interviewer feel good about their questions
	- "Oh, that's a really interesting question, let me think about that..."
	- "That's a great question...
	- I love that you asked about that..."
