 I think modesty is what holds me back the most, I want to be modest and feel like I don’t deserve to work on these things because I am not good enough or won’t be good enough. If other people will do it better than me I should just let them do it.
- This makes no sense, it does not matter if they do it, why let them have the pleasure of doing the work. You can have the pleasure of doing the work as well even if it not as good as theirs. 
- You can still do it and try and that is all you need to do.
