[[How I create unique perspectives]]

i want a way to link the sources to my perspectives, the content i consume or creates these  perspectives?


[[happiness]]
- [[Freedom and flexility over one’s life is the best predictor of wellbeing]]
- [[You are happiest when working towards your goals, not when you have achieved them]]
- [[You need 3 hobbies, one that keeps you healthy, one that earns you money and one to be creative]]
- [[Your don't get happy from achieving your goal, you get happiness from the seeing progress towards your goal]]
- [[One of the easiest ways to be unhappy is to constantly think about problems you have no control over ]]

[[business]]
- [[Opportunity is everywhere,  all you need is to make something better]]
- [[People are willing to pay if you present valuable information in a neat and organized and pretty way.]]
- [[Ideas are nothing what truly matters is execution]]


[[learning]]
- [[Learning how to learning is the ultimate skill that will give you the power to do what you love]]
-  [[I made sure to always prioritize what I was feeling the most interested in, not what I felt like I should be learning]]
- [[You have to do it incorrectly first to figure out how to do it correctly]]

[[success]]
- [[It is not that hard to be successful because most of people are distracted on their phones or TVs ]]
- [[Nothing happens then everything happens]]
- [[It is not the people who make the best decisions that are the most successful it the ones to make the most decisions and continuously iterate on those decisions.]]
- [[If you want to do something right, do it yourself, because other people don't care enough.]]
- [[Combining different strengths sets you apart and leads to exceptional results by creating are opportunities.]]
- [[Build something just to prove to myself that I can, don't do it for the users, or money, do it because you can]]
- [[I consider myself ambitions in the sense that I want to see what I am capable of given the mind and body I was born with]]
- [[Originality is overrated, you should copy]]

[[money]]
- [[Time is limited but money is abundant, make sure to spend your time wisely]]
- [[Money is a required pursuit for life but a pointless pursuit upon death]]

[[creativity]]
- [[I don't believe in consuming just to consume, I want to consume to create]]
- [[The act of creating is more important than what is created]]


[[life]]
- [[Validate everything you learn through experimentation on your own life]]
- [[You cannot buy a calm mind, fit body and healthy relationships. Building healthy relationships is just a byproduct of having a fit body and a healthy mind]]
- [[Life gets harder when you try to make it easy]]
- [[You can do things tired or when you don’t want to]]
- [[Focus on making each day great, as a great life is a string of great days.]]

[[confidence]]
- [[Past progress is proof of future potential]]

[[productivity]]

[[relationships]]
- [[Investing life energy into controllable aspects, such as personal interests and goals, is a smarter choice than pursuing a relationship, which is not entirely within your control. ]]
- [[I am even not even close to where I want to be in life to sacrifice that time into something outside of myself]]
- [[You can tell how much you love yourself based on the partner you choose]]
