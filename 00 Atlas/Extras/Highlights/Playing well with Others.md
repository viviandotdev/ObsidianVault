> The Barnum effect refers to the tendency for people to accept as uncannily descriptive of themselves the same generally worded assessment as long as they believe it was written specifically for them on the basis of some ‘diagnostic’ instrument such as a horoscope or personality inventory

> When we’re told some vague quality with a high base rate conveys a relevant story, we want it to be true. In fact, we look for evidence to make it true. And we have a strong bias toward remembering things that confirm our beliefs and forgetting things that don’t.

> Truth be told, if you wanted to focus on something, skip body language and laser focus on their speech. When we can hear someone but not see them, empathic ability declines only about 4 percent. When we can see someone but not hear them, the drop-off is a whopping 54 percent. Pay less attention to whether they cross their legs and more attention to when their voice changes.

If something doesn’t promote your survival and reproduction, his math shows that evolution will not select for it. But if you do something because it promotes your survival and reproduction, it’s not altruistic. George thought to himself, Did I just prove there is no such thing as kindness?

> In psychology it’s called “self-expansion theory”—that we expand our notion of our self to include those we’re close to. A series of experiments demonstrated that the closer you are to a friend, the more the boundary between the two of you blurs. We actually confuse elements of who they are with who we are. When you’re tight with a friend, your brain actually has to work harder to distinguish the two of you.

Closeness is when your vision of your “self” scooches over and makes room for someone else to be in there too.What is a friend? A friend is another self. A part of you.

Sometimes more, sometimes less, but either way—yowzers, that’s a lot of time.

> only is vulnerability effective, it’s also not quite as dangerous as you think. Psychology has documented the “beautiful mess effect”—that we consistently overestimate how negatively our errors will be perceived. We think we’ll be seen as a moron and exiled to a distant village, but when surveyed, most people see the occasional screw-up as a positive. You make an error and are terrified you’ll be seen as inadequate. But when others make the same error, you’re rarely as judgmental, and it often warms you to that person.

> And when your friend admits vulnerable things, do not recoil and scream, “YOU DID WHAT?!?!” Accept them. Then, Daniel Hruschka says, “raise the stakes.” As long as you feel emotionally safe and you’re getting a positive reception, share more. That’s how you build “another self.”

> are you feeling sad? Lost interest in things you usually enjoy doing? No appetite? Trouble sleeping? Tired? Can’t concentrate? Yeah, that’s being lovesick. But if you have five of those six, you’d also qualify for “major depressive episode” under DSM criteria. Feeling both sets of symptoms? Sounds like love to me. It’s also indistinguishable from bipolar disorder. And Tallis, a psychiatrist, says love actually is often misdiagnosed by those in the mental health profession.

And a 1994 paper showed after thirty-five years it was actually the passionate bickering couples who were the only ones to still have a happy marriage
