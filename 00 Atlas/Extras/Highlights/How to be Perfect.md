# Notes from How to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question
## by Michael Schur

## Highlights
---
> The categorical imperative states that we can’t just find rules that tell us how we ought to behave—we have to find rules that we could imagine everyone else following too. Before we do something, we have to determine what would happen if everyone did it; and if a world in which everyone did it would be all screwed up, that means we’re not allowed to do it. So, should we lie to our friend? No. Because first we have to imagine a world where everyone lies—and in such a world, we’d realize, no one would ever trust each other, human communication would cease to function, all interactions would become suspect, and even lying (the thing we’re thinking about doing) would lose its point. So: we can’t lie to anyone, ever, for any reason. (See? The dude is hard-core.)

---
> There’s no followable maxim involving the creation of “happiness,” because “happiness” is something subjective that we can only define for ourselves. Nothing in the world, no matter how simple, will make everyone happy—my own daughter, Ivy, doesn’t like cake, and my son, William, doesn’t like ice cream—so we cannot possibly design a rule involving “making people happy” that we would want everyone to follow. What makes me happy will make someone else deeply sad or indifferent or maybe happy but in a different way or to a different degree. So,

---
> Act only out of duty to follow a universal maxim
> Derive these maxims using your pure reason
> Happiness is irrelevant
> End of poem

---
> The individual does not and cannot exist alone.… He owes his existence to other people including those of past generations and his contemporaries. He is simply part of the whole.… Whatever happens to the individual happens to the whole group, and whatever happens to the whole group happens to the individual. The individual can only say, “I am, because we are; and since we are therefore I am.

---
> We don’t just owe things to people—we owe our whole freaking existence to them. And when we think of “other people” that way, well, we’re not going to stop at the minimal amount that we “owe to each other”—we’re gonna damn well return the shopping cart to the rack if we think it eases the burden of those around us. All we’re really doing here is making sure the checklist we run down anytime we’re deciding what to do puts “community health and happiness

---
> This has been a core tenet of Southern African philosophy for centuries, but in Western philosophy the contractualist idea that our moral lives are dependent on our mutual relationships with other people is more of an outlier

---
> virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, contractualism, ubuntu

---
> If flourishing is the ultimate human purpose, it requires us to protect ourselves a little from suffering. “I don’t have to loan my renal system to a random violinist at the complete unending expense of my own life and happiness” certainly falls within the bounds of the reasonable amount of “selfishness” a person should exhibit.5

---
> It’s also hard to claim that we are “maximizing good” by making a very risky bet that we—who are not in any way qualified to assess the dangers of a fire and then navigate the situation in order to save others—can succeed. And just like Aristotle’s overly courageous soldier taking on an entire army himself, recklessly charging into a burning building may certainly be labeled an excessively courageous act, tilting over into rashness. Like anything else, it’s a calculation: brave is good, foolish is not.

---
> pizza and Red Hot Chili Peppers” problem—that different people are made happy by different things.) And if we all became utilitarian Loving Saints, denying our own happiness for the sake of others, we’d all become deeply unhappy, and thus could potentially reduce the total happiness in the world, which is the opposite of what we’d be aiming for.

---
> We have focused mostly on the results of charitable giving (or tipping), and we ended up in a pragmatic/utilitarian conclusion that if good is maximized, motivation of the giver is secondary. But much like Kant, Hanh wants us to think about the act itself. If we give money to charity for our own happiness—if the goal is to be showered with praise and admiration—we are violating both Kant’s universal maxim and Hanh’s (or Buddha’s) view of what brings us actual happiness instead of a false equivalent. The mindful action—the doing of a thing with no intention but to do it—provides greater calm and joy

---
> And how would a Kantian be disappointed in me? Let us count the ways. I’m pretty sure that “we should force people involved in minor traffic incidents to weigh the relative importance of their car repair against the needs created by national catastrophes before receiving restitution” violates the categorical imperative. Could we will that rule into existence, to be used by everyone all the time? No. That way madness lies. But the Kantian doesn’t stop there. She also certainly says I violated the second formulation of the imperative, because I used the guy as a means to any number of ends: helping people who had nothing to do with the accident… mollifying my own anger at the treatment of New Orleans hurricane victims… making a statement about the absurdities of Los Angeles auto insurance. I mean, if you’re a Kantian and you want to find a way to criticize my behavior, the world’s your oyster. (I don’t even want to think about how a contractualist would react to what I did. T. M. Scanlon would be so disappointed in me if he ever heard this story. No one tell him.)
> Aristotle might

---
> Shame has a function in a healthy world, because it gives us a weapon in the war against bad behavior. If people were incapable of feeling shame, they would do whatever they wanted to with impunity, never worrying that their reputations might suffer in the public square. The act of lightly shaming our fellow citizens for unvirtuous actions or beliefs may therefore be okay; this isn’t guesswork on my part—Aristotle actually says that while shame is not a virtue, per se

---
> how we described Aristotle’s approach to mildness—the golden mean represents an appropriate amount of anger, directed only at people who deserve it. That’s the key to my own blunder regarding the Saab guy. He didn’t deserve the tornado of shame I whipped up and sent at him

---
> Here we’re confronting a condition I think of as Moral Exhaustion.2,3 Trying to do the right thing all the time is—and I’m going to use a fairly wonky, technical philosophy term here, so bear with me—a huge pain in the ass

---
> But there’s a serious point here: the shifting of an Overton window often happens gradually, and we readjust to its new range very quickly,9 so there is risk in allowing ourselves to do anything we know is bad just because we want to. In fact, even with good intentions and level heads, if we give in to our lesser instincts too often there’s a far more likely outcome than “we become black market weapons dealers.” It’s simply that we become selfish. We start to believe that our own “right” to do whatever we want, whenever we want to do it, is more important than anything else, and thus our sense of morality concerns only our own happiness or pain. We become… Ayn Rand

---
> It’s frankly dispiriting that a woman who advocated radical selfishness and utter disdain for everyone but oneself wasn’t booed off the world stage, but even today Rand has plenty of adherents, especially among those who call themselves libertarians. (There are more than a few Randites in the U.S. Congress—former

---
> She is basically telling her readers that the only thing they need to do to be morally pure is greedily protect their own interests. A diet book that claimed you could lose weight by eating pecan pie and drinking Mountain Dew Code Red would definitely sell a few copies. 

---
> since Deb is clearly violating the categorical imperative—she could certainly not will that her action become a universal law. If everyone did what she did (wait until the trolleys are packed and then grab a free ride without paying) the entire commuter system would break down, because no one would pay, because they’d all be aiming to snag a free ride. Pretty clearly “wrong,” when you approach it from Kant’s perspective

---
> But… no one on the trolley was really inconvenienced—they all got to their destinations in the same amount of time they would’ve if Deb had not hitched her free ride. Which means that from a utilitarian point of view, this kind of worked out—Deb’s sneaky maneuver increased the amount of total happiness in the world (more people got to their destinations), without any additional pain

---
>  really don’t mean to argue for perfect living, or moral sainthood, or anything close to that, because (a) it’s impossible, and (b) I don’t even think it’s a good goal. Instead, I’m arguing that when we do fail, in matters great or small, we just take a second to acknowledge our failure to ourselves, and try to remember that feeling the next time we have a decision to make. That’s why it’s instructive to focus on something as small as jaywalking or hitching a free ride on a trolley. Deb’s actions may have been more justifiable than we thought, or less. They may be noticed by other people or go completely unseen. But whatever the case, we can only hope that the little voice in Deb’s head chirps loudly enough to keep her from making this a habit, or at least to warn her that she’s been doing stuff like this a lot recently and ought to knock it off.

---
> But if guilt is how we police ourselves, we need to allow ourselves to feel that guilt, and we need to listen to our guilty consciences when they give us pause. That’s one of the biggest hindrances to making use of our individual guidance systems—too many of us just don’t pin those slightly damning receipts up on our cubicle walls so they can remind us of these little bad things we’ve done

---
> He said that it denies us our integrity—our sense of being a whole and undivided person—and sacrifices our individual core projects in the name of a nonspecific mass human “happiness.” Utilitarianism can sometimes deny us the things that make us “us.”

---
> Our lives are our own, and we shouldn’t feel bad about filling them with experiences and even objects that give those lives shape and dimension. Following Singer’s logic, I shouldn’t have gone to that game at all, really, because World Series tickets are expensive. We maybe shouldn’t have bought nachos and a hot dog for my son, we shouldn’t have paid for parking… in fact, I probably shouldn’t pay for the special MLB cable package that lets me watch Red Sox games. It can get very silly, very quickly.

---
> Just as in the previous chapter, when we hoped that Deb the Free-Riding Ninja would acknowledge her own shortcomings so as not to nudge her Overton window toward worse behavior, we need to be our own judges. Let’s say we give fifty bucks to the Save the American Pelicans Fund

---
> Try again. Fail again. Fail better.16 It’s the best we can do, and often, even if we’ve bought into that philosophy, it doesn’t feel that great to live this way. The more carefully we examine our decisions, the more tempting it seems to ignore all the moral dilemmas we’ll inevitably discover. They’re so complicated and annoying that we might conclude it’s easier—and no worse in ethical terms—to simply keep doing what we were already doing.
> … I mean, is that an option? Maybe?

---
> thorniest moral issues of our time: Can we separate the things we like from the people who make them? And should we?

---
> And by the way, we’ve also argued that the richer and more powerful you are, the more you owe other people, because when we’re sitting around coming up with rules that define what we owe to each other, the powerful can more easily bear the weight of sacrifice. A contractualist rejects Snyder’s rule, which probably suggests we ought to stop supporting the team

---
> Deontology won’t be any more lenient with him. Snyder’s arguing that he could will into existence a world where once anyone gets enough money or achieves enough influence, he can stop considering the feelings or needs of those less fortunate

---
> Applying virtue ethics: we’re essentially asking how compassionate we should be when it comes to issues that cause people anguish or pain. Being excessively compassionate might lead to lack of integrity, or backbone, or something—nearly everything in the culture is some kind of iffy, so we’d constantly be dropping whatever we were doing and searching for something else that comes with no moral entanglements at all (an impossible pipe dream, here in 2022)

---
> On the other hand, a deficiency of compassion leads to… what Daniel Snyder is: shut down, defiant, impenetrable, resistant to new ideas, calcified, and utterly uninterested in the emotional health of other people. Somewhere between those extremes is a golden mean of compassion

---
> Remember, it’s not strictly the number of people who feel pain in each of the two different outcomes—it’s the total amount of pain felt, and the intensity of that pain, and its duration, and like four other things from that jaunty little poem. For the utilitarian, it’s better to have a hundred people get paper cuts than one person take a baseball bat to the knee. So even if the number of people who feel pain (Native Americans and their allies, in this case) were smaller than the number of people who feel pleasure, there might be significantly more total pain if Snyder keeps the name the same.

---
> Is there some amount of caring that is good and lets us feel like we are being thoughtful, considerate citizens and consumers who factor in morality when we make entertainment decisions, but also gives us a little bit of a break so we can love the things we love? Hopefully?

---
> The most important part of becoming better people, I’ll say yet again, is that we care about whether what we do is good or bad, and therefore try to do the right thing. If we love a problematic person or thing too much to part with it altogether, I think that means we have to keep two ideas in our head at the same time:
>  
> 1. I love this thing.
> 2. The person who made it is troubling.
> Forgetting about (1) means we lose a piece of ourselves. Forgetting about (2) means we are denying that this thing causes us (and others) anguish, and thus

---
> “You just told me there is no God and no ‘meaning’ to our existence, and that all we have are our choices, and now you’re telling me to make choices that model behavior for all of humanity?



# How to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question (Michael Schur)

From the creator of The Good Place and the cocreator of Parks and Recreation, a hilarious, thought-provoking guide to living an ethical life, drawing on 2,400 years of deep thinking from around the world.Most people think of themselves as "good," but it's not always easy to determine what's "good" or "bad"—especially in a world filled with complicated choices and pitfalls and booby traps and bad advice. Fortunately, many smart philosophers have been pondering this conundrum for millennia and they have guidance for us. With bright wit and deep insight, How to Be Perfect explains concepts like deontology, utilitarianism, existentialism, ubuntu, and more so we can sound cool at parties and become better people. Schur starts off with easy ethical questions like "Should I punch my friend in the face for no reason?" (No.) and works his way up to the most complex moral issues we all face. Such as: Can I still enjoy great art if it was...

### Chapter One

> Aristotle actually uses the nebulous word “eudaimonia,” which sometimes gets translated as “happiness” and sometimes as “flourishing.”5 I prefer “flourishing,” because that feels like a bigger deal than “happiness.” We’re talking about the ultimate objective for humans here, and a flourishing person sounds like she’s more fulfilled, complete, and impressive than a “happy” person.

> Aristotle defines virtues as the things that “cause [their] possessors to be in a good state and to perform their functions well.” So, the virtues of a knife are those qualities that make it good at being a knife, and the virtues of a horse are the horse’s inherent qualities that make it good at galloping and other horsey stuff

> In other words: without any anger, if we saw something cruel—like a bully picking on an innocent kid—we might just stand there, slack-jawed and drooling, rather than responding with an appropriate amount of indignation. But if we have way too much anger, we might grab the bully and dropkick him into a lake and then grab his whole family and dropkick them into the lake and then burn their house down.
