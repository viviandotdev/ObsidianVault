## Highlights
The next set of data points you must estimate are in the Financing section; these include your down payment amount, loan interest rate, private mortgage insurance (PMI) percentage, loan term, lender points, and any other financing fees.

The property value growth data point looks at how much a median house or condo value has gone up since the year 2000. With declining or stagnant median property values, it is difficult to take advantage of one of the major pillars of real estate investing—appreciatio

With a declining or stagnant population, it is unlikely that property values and incomes would increase, which leads to subpar rental property conditions. As a baseline, a growth rate of 20 percent or more is considered satisfactory by many investors’ standards.

Let’s look at a few of the most popular situations and how your property type decision could impact the demand for your rental unit. If you are looking to buy a duplex in a location with a lot of single-family homes and/or a lot of new-build apartments, the demand for your rental unit may be a bit low. That does not mean you would not be able to find a high-quality tenant; it just means that you may have a more difficult time and/or would not be able to demand the market rent. If someone can rent a single-family home or a newly built apartment unit for the same cost as your duplex unit, what would attract them to rent your unit? If they have lived in this area for a significant period, they may have become accustomed to the most common living situations in that area, which yours is not.

After repair value (ARV) is the value of a property after it has been renovated and is ready to be sold. For residential properties, the ARV is calculated by using the comparable method, also commonly referred to as “comps.”

---
On the other hand, if you purchase a duplex in a town that has hundreds of duplexes, renters in that area are likely more used to that type of living situation and would be more open to renting your unit. The same can be said for single-family houses, triplexes, and fourplexes. If the property type is more common in a given area, the more likely you are to have tenants that are willing and interested in that type of property, which increases the demand for your rental unit(s).

The six key data points used to analyze cities are population growth, income growth, property value growth, crime level, crime change, and job growth.

---
Depreciation is a non-cash, accounting expense that you can often deduct from your rental income when house hacking. The IRS allows investors to write off depreciation as a way to account for the wear and tear a property receives. 

---
You calculate your cost of living when house hacking by determining your total mortgage cost, including principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and PMI, then subtracting your total rental income. The difference between your rental income and total mortgage cost is your profit, if rental income is higher, or your living cost, if rental income is lower.

Your next considerations in the analysis are your reserves, which include repairs and maintenance, CAPEX, and vacancy, then property taxes, insurance, utilities, landscaping, HOA fees, and any other monthly or annual fees you may have

---
While house hacking may not always be glamorous, and you will almost certainly need to make sacrifices for a period, consider the alternatives. Would you rather make sacrifices for three to eight years and live the rest of your life in financial freedom, or would you rather live a more typical lifestyle and postpone retirement until your sixties?

One of the benefits of house hacking is that it helps prepare you to become a real estate investor outside of house hacking properties

---
For CAPEX, as well as repairs and maintenance, the percentages can be adjusted based on the age, quality, size, type, and location of your property. Typically, older properties require more maintenance, in the form of both repairs and CAPEX, unless these items have already been completed by a previous owner. 

---
The first data points that need to be estimated for your expenses are your acquisition costs, which include the purchase price after repair value (ARV) or expected sale value; closing costs; and repair costs. 

---
Rentometer is a database of rental data that allows you to enter your property’s address into a search bar and get a list of properties in the area and their rental rate

---
With a declining or stagnant median household income, rents and property values are unlikely to increase. As a guideline, target cities where the median income has grown by more than 30 percent since the year 2000.

In the companion calculator for this book, you will find a Monthly column and a Year 1 column under the Profit & Loss section. These are the two most common columns investors look at when conducting a profitability analysis. The first column tells you your numbers on a monthly basis, and the second column shows your numbers on an annual basis.
Starting at the top of your upside-down pyramid, you will see your total income, encompassing your rental income and any other secondary income sources. Below that you will see your all-in mortgage amount and any other expenses you may have. The all-in mortgage is the total amount you will be required to pay the bank each month for the property. This includes your principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and PMI. Your other expenses typically include water, sewer, electricity, landscaping, HOA fees, and any other miscellaneous expenses you may have.

Here are a few questions you can ask real estate agents to help determine which neighborhoods are a good fit for you:

Which neighborhoods do you think are the nicest and safest?
Why do you think that? How are other neighborhoods of less quality?
Are you investing in real estate here? If so, which area(s) of the city are you investing in?
What is the typical rent in those areas for [insert your specific property type(s) here]? How does that compare to other areas in the city?
In which part of the city do you receive the highest rent for [insert your specific property type(s) here]?
Where do you currently see a lot of other investors buying?
Which parts of the city are people moving to? Why?
Are there any major developments in the city that you are aware of that may positively or negatively impact a given area?
