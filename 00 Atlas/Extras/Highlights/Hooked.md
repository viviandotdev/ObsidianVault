## Highlights
Fogg posits that there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.

---
As Erika Hall, author of Just Enough Research   writes, “When the research focuses on what people actually do   (watch cat videos) rather than what they wish they did (produce cinema-quality home movies) it actually expands possibilities

---
Time—how long it takes to complete an action.
Money—the fiscal cost of taking an action.
Physical effort—the amount of labor involved in taking the action.
Brain cycles—the level of mental effort and focus required to take an action.
Social deviance—how accepted the behavior is by others.
Non-routine—according to Fogg, “How much the action matches or disrupts existing routines.”

---
The Fogg Behavior Model is represented in the formula B = MAT, which represents that a given behavior will occur when motivation, ability, and a trigger are present at the same time and in sufficient degrees

---
Influencing behavior by reducing the effort required to perform an action is more effective than increasing someone’s desire to do it. Make your product so simple that users already know how to use it, and you’ve got a winner.

---
The appearance of scarcity affected their perception of value.

---
The study demonstrates the endowed progress effect, a phenomenon that increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal

---
Unfortunately, too many companies build their products betting users will do what they make   them do instead of letting them do what they want   to do

---
The phrase “But you are free to accept or refuse.”
The “but you are free” technique demonstrates how we are more likely to be persuaded to give when our ability to choose is reaffirmed

---
The search for resources defines the next type of variable reward—the rewards of the hunt.

The need to acquire physical objects, such as food and other supplies that aid our survival, is part of our brain’s operating system.

---
Experiences with finite variability become increasingly predictable with use and lose their appeal over time. Experiences that maintain user interest by sustaining variability with use exhibit infinite variability

---
The collection of memories and experiences, in aggregate, becomes more valuable over time and the service becomes harder to leave as users’ personal investment in the site grows

---
In Twitter, for example, the investment comes in the form of following another user. There is no immediate reward for following someone, no stars or badges to affirm the action. Following is an investment in the service, which increases the likelihood of the user checking Twitter in the future

---
To avoid the cognitive dissonance of not liking something that others seem to take so much pleasure in, we slowly change our perception of the thing we once did not enjoy.

---
1. What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal trigger )
2. What brings users to your service? (External trigger )
3. What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action )
4. Are users fulfilled by the reward yet left wanting more? (Variable reward )
5. What “bit of work” do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use? (Investment )

---
The more effort we put into something, the more likely we are to value it; we are more likely to be consistent with our past behaviors; and finally, we change our preferences to avoid cognitive dissonance

---
Also in contrast to the action phase, the investment phase increases friction.

---
The enemy of forming new habits is past behaviors, and research suggests that old habits die hard

---
A company can begin to determine its product’s habit-forming potential by plotting two factors: frequency   (how often the behavior occurs) and perceived utility   (how useful and rewarding the behavior is in the user’s mind over alternative solutions)

---
Painkillers solve an obvious need, relieving a specific pain, and often have quantifiable markets.

Think Tylenol, the brand-name version of acetaminophen, and the product’s promise of reliable relief. It’s the kind of ready-made solution for which people are happy to pay.

Vitamins, by contrast, do not necessarily solve an obvious pain point. Instead they appeal to users’ emotional rather than functional needs.

---
A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of pain.

---
Seeking pleasure and avoiding pain are two key motivators in all species. When we feel discomfort, we seek to escape the uncomfortable sensation

---
External triggers are embedded with information, which tells the user what to do next.



---
1. Paid Triggers
Advertising

---
3. Relationship Triggers
One person telling others about a product or service can be a highly effective external trigger for action.

---
For example, an app icon on the user’s phone screen, an e-mail newsletter to which the user subscribes, or an app update notification only appears if the user wants it there. As long as the user agrees to receive a trigger, the company that sets the trigger owns   a share of the user’s attention.


---
featured app store placements are all effective ways to gain attention.

---
Earned Triggers

---
Internal triggers manifest automatically in your mind. Connecting internal triggers with a product is the brass ring of consumer technology.

---
Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily routines.

---
You’ll often find that people’s declared preferences   —what they say they want—are far different from their revealed preferences   —what they actually do.

---
We’ve built a detailed narrative of our user, Julie, that helps us answer the following series of whys:

Why #1:   Why would Julie want to use e-mail?

Answer:   So she can send and receive messages.

Why #2:   Why would she want to do that?

Answer:   Because she wants to share and receive information quickly.

Why #3:   Why does she want to do that?

Answer:   To know what’s going on in the lives of her coworkers, friends, and family.

Why #4:   Why does she need to know that?

Answer: To know if someone needs her.

Why #5:   Why would she care about that?

Answer:   She fears being out of the loop

---
Fogg states that all humans are motivated to seek pleasure and avoid pain; to seek hope and avoid fear; and finally, to seek social acceptance and avoid rejection. 

---
The Scarcity Effect

---
The mind takes shortcuts informed by our surroundings to make quick and sometimes erroneous judgments.

---
The sample started with a $5 wine and progressed to a $90 bottle. Interestingly, as the price of the wine increased, so did the participants’ enjoyment of the wine.

---
their brain corroborated their feelings, showing higher spikes in the regions associated with pleasure.

---
People often anchor to one piece of information when making a decision.



---
ites such as LinkedIn and Facebook utilize this heuristic to encourage people to divulge more information about themselves when completing their online profiles. On LinkedIn every user starts with some semblance of progress (figure 19). The next step is to “Improve Your Profile Strength” by supplying additional information.

---
Heuristics

 are cognitive shortcuts we take to make quick decisions. Product designers can utilize many of the hundreds of heuristics to increase the likelihood of their desired action.

---
 I propose that variable rewards come in three types: the tribe , the hunt   , and the self   (figure 20). Habit-forming products utilize one or more of these variable reward types.

---

Our brains are adapted to seek rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included.

---
 Logging in reveals an endless stream of content friends have shared, comments from others, and running tallies of how many people have “liked” something. The uncertainty of what users will find each time they visit the site creates the intrigue needed to pull them back again.

---
By awarding money in random intervals, games of chance entice players with the prospect of a jackpot. 

---
“feed” has become a social staple of many online products. The stream of limitless information displayed in a scrolling interface makes for a compelling reward of the hunt. 

---
Rewards of the self are a defining component in video games, as players seek to master the skills needed to pursue their quest.

---
Yet to feel rewarded, the user must have a sense of accomplishment.

---
Their self-determination theory espouses that people desire, among other things, to gain a sense of competency. Adding an

---
Element of mystery to this goal makes the pursuit all the more enticing

---
Products must ensure the users feel in control. People must want to use the service, not feel they have to.

---
Experiences with finite variability become less engaging because they eventually become predictable.

---
World of Warcraft   is frequently played with teams; it is the hard-to-predict behavior of other people that keeps the game interesting.

---
Dribbble, a platform for designers and artists to showcase their work, exemplify the longer-lasting engagement that comes from infinite variability

---
E-mail, for example, utilizes all three variable reward types.

---
Reputation makes users, both buyers and sellers, more likely to stick with whichever service they have invested their efforts in to maintain a high-quality score

---
Once users have invested the effort to acquire a skill, they are less likely to switch to a competing product.

---
Users pass through the investment phase of the Hook Model each time they send a selfie, doodle, or goofy photo. 

---
Pinterest users invest in the site every time they pin an image of their own, repin someone else’s image, comment on, or like a piece of content on the sit

---
The internal trigger for users is often boredom, for which the site offers a quick cure. Once registered, the only action required of users is to start scrolling as Pinterest showcases a wealth of variable rewards. First, because Pinterest is a socially curated collection of interesting items, the site displays a powerful intermittent reward surrounding the hunt for objects of desire, even if they are only images. The site also provides a means of communicating with friends and people who share similar tastes. The rewards of the tribe come from the variability of posting images as a communication medium. A user might be curious to know what a friend has pinned not only because of the image itself, but because of her relationship with the pinner

---
To use the Manipulation Matrix (figure 36), the maker needs to ask two questions. First, “Would I use the product myself?” and second, “Will the product help users materially improve their lives?”

---
**Facilitators**
Use their own product and believe it can materially improve people’s lives. They have the highest chance of success because they most closely understand the needs of their users.

--- 

**Peddlers**
Believe their product can materially improve people’s lives but do not use it themselves. They must beware of the hubris and inauthenticity that comes from building solutions for people they do not understand firsthand.

---

**Entertainers**
Use their product but do not believe it can improve people’s lives. They can be successful, but without making the lives of others better in some way, the entertainer’s products often lack staying power.
 
--- 

**Dealers**
Neither use the product nor believe it can improve people’s lives. They have the lowest chance of finding long-term success and often find themselves in morally precarious positions.
