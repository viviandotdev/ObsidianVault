## Highlights
In studies where researchers show people pictures on a computer screen of other people’s faces, those without social anxiety tend to look at the whole face. They start by looking at the other person’s eyes, then the nose and mouth, and then around to the cheeks, jaw, forehead and other areas. People who are shy and anxious start by looking at the other person’s eyes, then they hyper-focus on two primary areas: the innermost portion of the eyebrows and the corners of the mouth. They are searching for lowering of the eyebrows, which is an expression of anger, and curling of the corners of the mouth, which can indicate disdain or disgust. — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=386) ^ref-63887

Carl Jung had a saying that the more personal an experience is, the more universal it is. You just might find there are more people than you think who are dealing with these very same challenges. — location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=425) ^ref-52284

Social confidence is a felt experience of knowing you have worth and value, being comfortable with and accepting of yourself, and enjoying connecting with other people. — location: [867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=867) ^ref-1907

The key to breaking free from social anxiety is to start becoming clearer about who you are, not who you think someone else wants you to be in order to accept you. — location: [1047](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1047) ^ref-34709

The first step is to take less responsibility for the feelings of the people around you. This can be an uncomfortable proposition if you have spent much of your life learning to read others and accommodate their needs and desires. One simple, yet powerful, way to start making this shift is to regularly remind yourself with this phrase: I am not responsible for your feelings. — location: [1077](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1077) ^ref-35735

An incredibly powerful practice for developing differentiation is to actually disagree with people more. — location: [1145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1145) ^ref-59309

This is known as the “Mother Hen Syndrome.” If you were to select the restaurant, you might feel responsible for everyone’s experience at the restaurant. You might feel a pressure for everyone to love the food and have a great time. If they do not, that means you are not good enough, you did not pick a good enough place, and there is something wrong with you. — location: [1182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1182) ^ref-46692

Sharing what you want helps other people know you, even if you do not get it. — location: [1196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1196) ^ref-43783

---
Self-denying occurs when you put the needs, desires, and preferences of others above your own. Instead of realizing that both your needs and their needs matter, you assume that their needs matter more, and yours are secondary. Any time you think about putting yourself first or taking care of your needs, you get the feeling that you are selfish, bad, or wrong. — location: [1248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1248) ^ref-15720

Each time you discover what you want and speak it, you are honoring who you are in this moment. — location: [1298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1298) ^ref-56482

key step in overcoming social anxiety is changing your self-concept. More specifically, it involves challenging your strongly held negative perceptions of yourself while also searching for more realistic perceptions of your strengths and abilities. — location: [1366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1366) ^ref-1867

---
When we fully acknowledge and own our own strengths, we simply know on a deep level what we are good at. We can draw a sense of self, pride, identity, and worth from these qualities. The more we truly own these strengths, the less we need to brag, explain, or otherwise try to impress others. We simply know our value. — location: [1415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1415) ^ref-5184

---
These comparisons carry a heavy weight, as we are often subconsciously concluding that because this person is funnier than we are, he is a better human being. Next to him, we do not deserve to exist. This type of extreme comparison is born out of discounting your own strengths and value to the world. Once you are able to claim your strengths and internalize them, comparisons take on a very different quality. The human worth element is taken out of the equation and the charge is removed. You are able to simply acknowledge if someone is taller, smarter, faster, better or worse looking. There is no conclusion about their worth as a person. — location: [1477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1477) ^ref-34700

When your purpose is focused on the other person, or on connecting, you will most likely be more present and able to relate to them in a relaxed, confident manner. — location: [1644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1644) ^ref-63883

Your life purpose is not a goal or an end result. It is a way of being in the world. Your purpose is a verb. It describes who you want to be, how you want to be, what you want to create, give, and contribute to the world while you are here. — location: [1675](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=1675) ^ref-23083

your way home from dinner, your critic starts to act up. You got too excited when you were talking about skiing. You sounded like such a dork. You were over the top, way too excited.

In reality, many people struggle with this. Literally millions of people have social anxiety, and struggle with it intensely—perhaps more intensely than you do. Realizing you are not alone in your suffering — location: [2155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2155) ^ref-26386

My darling, I care about your suffering. It is a statement of incredible validation, acknowledgement, and kindness, and stands in stark contrast to the negative, critical ways we might typically react to our suffering: You’re feeling this way again!

While that is an essential skill, we do not want to repair ourselves after each attack just to keep getting re-injured. We want to develop a strong, positive forward front so that we are actively encouraging and supporting ourselves, rather than just responding to continual internal threats. — location: [2205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2205) ^ref-44031

Commit for the day to notice and acknowledge 10 things that you did well or that are going well in a given day. They can be very simple, small things. The key is not to count only significant events, but to count many small events with a high frequency. — location: [2223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2223) ^ref-13381

There will be a magnetism about you that comes from you being truly comfortable in your own skin. This comfort draws others to you and can help them learn to be more comfortable with themselves as well. — location: [2264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2264) ^ref-54171

The first two components of the solution to social anxiety can be seen as the internal foundation of social confidence. Knowing who you are and having a strong sense of yourself can help you break free from the judgments—and the perceived judgments—of others. — location: [2270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2270) ^ref-61591

When people step forward and put themselves out there, it’s not a matter of how much fear they feel, but rather how willing they are to take action in spite of the fear. — location: [2392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2392) ^ref-4083

Imaginal exposure — location: [2432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2432) ^ref-1763

When it comes to the more intimidating numbers on your hierarchy (seven and above), it can be helpful to practice before you engage in the activity. One powerful way to practice from the comfort of your own home is through what is referred to as imaginal exposure. This involves vividly creating the scene in your mind before you engage in the activity. Your body responds to vivid imagery and your imagination almost as potently as if you were actually in the scenario. — location: [2433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2433) ^ref-59545

Rejection does not mean you are inadequate. It simply means that right now, the answer is no. — location: [2523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2523) ^ref-60411

---
It’s important to realize that the purpose of completing these activities is not to succeed without any negative responses or rejections, but to actually experience rejection. — location: [2561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2561) ^ref-26647

---
Assuming approval involves taking all of these behaviors and attitudes, and consciously acting them out when you engage with people you do not know as well. In a way you are assuming friendship, as if you have known each other for years. What would this look like for you? Often it involves being more relaxed in your body, touching people on the shoulder or back, laughing out loud, making jokes, teasing, being playful, saying whatever comes to mind, asking questions about whatever you are curious about, and generally being your natural self. — location: [2626](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2626) ^ref-9268

The alternative is to step into life, to move towards what we want in spite of what we fear, to try again and again with an unreasonable refusal to quit. As Les Brown would say, the alternative is to take life on5. — location: [2701](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2701) ^ref-21038

Even if you turned it down by 80%, you would still probably be more considerate, tactful, and respectful of other’s opinions than a majority of people. — location: [2754](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F5IU5CU&location=2754) ^ref-45973
