### Be Water, My Friend
## Shannon Lee

## Highlights
---
> For my father, being “in the flow” meant, in part, being present—choosing to live his life consciously, purposefully, intentionally. Being present means more than occupying physical space. It’s not just about whether you show up for class, but whether you are actively participating in class

---
> The truth of the matter is that while, yes, we are involved in the sense that we are alive, as in breathing and doing things, many of us are not fully tapping into our consciousness, our self-awareness, and, ultimately, our potential. We are not proactively directing the course of our lives and paying attention to and working with our energy and the environments and relationships we find ourselves in. For many of us, life happens to us. We get trapped in unconscious patterns of living and forget that there are, in fact, many choices and many ways to be fully involved in the creation of our lives.

---
> presence and awareness play a big part in that. If my mind is polluted with all manner of negativity or I’m snapping at people out of pure emotional reaction, then I am not responding—I am reacting. If I am not aware of how I am feeling or what thoughts are going through my head, then how do I change bad habits or find more happiness and personal satisfaction? I need to be able to observe myself in order to see what I need to amend. If I am paying attention, then I can see what’s happening all around and within me, and only then am I free to choose how I want to participate. You can’t choose a response if you can’t even see that there are choices to be made.

---
> When your purpose is simply to be the most high-functioning and joyful version of you that you can be, then every moment can be an opportunity to fulfill your purpose, and the journey becomes so much more exciting. You now have your purpose no matter what. Even the difficulties become more manageable when we are committed to expressing the truth of who we are

---
> The journey of flowing toward self-actualization and wholeness is not undertaken lightly. It will require your full attention. But as you grow, you will begin to see and, more important, to experience a fluid interplay between the elements that make you you.

---
> Emptying your mind does not mean forgetting everything you’ve ever learned or giving up everything you believe. What it means is that you should try to meet each conversation, each interaction, and each experience with a willingness to consider something new without the burden of your judgment in the process

---
>  we go through our day, we are expert evidence collectors

---
> Because of our beliefs and our preferences, we walk around collecting the evidence of our experiences to bolster our beliefs. If I walk into a party with a sense of dread, then I am subconsciously looking for evidence of that dread to prove myself right

---
> We are always looking to be proved right. And when we have a need to be right, we will only accept that which substantiates our point of view.

---
> The difference between judgment and discernment may be hard to see right away, but practice asking yourself: “Am I judging right now? Or am I allowing information in with the goal of understanding what is really going on and how I really feel?” As you become more aware, you’ll be able to feel the difference between the two. A judgment may feel like a hard line running through you or like a shield that keeps things away from you. A discernment may feel more like water washing over you while you pan for gold—there’s a porousness, a fluidity as you sift through the information.

---
> My father called this the “grasping mind” or “sticky mind.” In martial arts, it refers to a moment in an encounter where you get stuck trying to enforce some strategy you may have that’s separate from what is actually happening in the present moment. You become too clever and jammed up with your training or your game plan or your emotions, and you stop responding to the moment as it actually unfolds. In other words, you get in your own way.

---
> And he did. He lost because he got too caught up in what he wanted the fight to be, rather than what the fight actually was. And when the fight started to deviate from his plan, he didn’t have enough flow, presence, maturity, and ability to respond appropriately in the moment and change course to alter the outcome. His mind was stuck in what he’d predetermined and hoped or assumed would happen, and he was unable to see, perceive, and respond to what was actually happening. He wasn’t present. His cup was too full.

---
> One quick practice I like to do is just to take the first phrase of my father’s “Be Water” quote and use it as a guided visualization toward quieting my mind and making space. I picture my mind like a sacred bowl filled with all my thoughts and feelings of the day, and as I say or think the words “Empty your mind; be formless, shapeless like water,” I picture all those thoughts emptying out and washing down through my body like a gentle waterfall. I let the worries, the to-do lists, and the stress just filter down through my being and drain into the earth. Then I sit quietly as the bowl of my mind refills with clean, clear, still water or white light or whatever feels good. You can also view your empty bowl as an invitation for it to fill with whatever you need to see or feel in that moment. The important thing is not to force a vision or a feeling. Just allow. And if nothing comes, then fill your bowl with clear water or light and wash it down your body once again. Feel yourself being nourished. Feel yourself as lighter. Breathe and relax and just take these minutes to empty out. This practice makes me think of this quote of my father’s:
> Who is there that can make muddy waters clear? But if allowed to remain still, it will become clear of itself. Who is there that can secure a state of absolute repose? But keep calm and let time go on, and the state of repose will gradually arrest

---
> Instead of reveling in his victory, my father used the lessons of the fight to begin a long, personal journey. He became interested in what it meant to be a well-rounded, physically fit, and fully creative fighter, what it meant to release oneself of limitations, and, most important for our purposes, what it meant to be a fluid human being

---
> My father never wanted to be called a master. He said, “Once you say you’ve reached the top, then there is nowhere to go but down.” Instead he considered himself to be the eternal student—always open to new ideas, new possibilities, new directions, and new growth.

---
> I’ve come to develop a great fondness for experimentation in my own life. I run small tests and scenarios all the time to see what personal insights the results may bear. I’ve done everything from trying to say yes to all invitations for a certain amount of time to sitting with a particular chant for a specific number of days to drinking warm lemon water every morning. I’ve participated in rituals and workshops that appeal to me or followed my intuition fanatically for a period or decided consciously to engage in a particular relationship to see where it goes. And nowadays, during all these experiments, I try to hold the posture and stance of emptiness—nonjudgment and openness—so that I can try to really see, feel, and understand the optimal way of being for me.

---
> This stance of curiosity can be both freeing and engaging. Instead of being a passive participant, a bystander who waits to be called on or someone who puts all the pressure on themselves to be dazzling, you can give yourself the role of the adventure seeker, the detective, the journalist, or the anthropologist. When you become actively engaged, even just observationally, and look through the lens of curiosity, a whole new world will open up to you, and nothing will be as dull or as scary as you imagined.

---
> There is always something to note. And sometimes the most valuable thing you discover is that what you’re doing or where you are is not where you want to be—and that gives you the opportunity to begin charting a path out of there! That kind of information can be pure gold. It can save you from continuing to pursue a path that is leading you away from your soul

---
> One of the core mandates of jeet kune do and my father’s life was this process: “Research your own experience. Reject what is useless. Accept what is useful. And add what is essentially your own

---
> Another way to say this is: Don’t give up your sovereignty or personal power. Claim your own path and your own experience. Be respectful and grateful for the signposts you encounter, the lessons you learn, and the teachers who point the way, but remember that you and you alone are responsible for your path and your growth

---
> Of course, some of the things that are actually good for you come with “shoulds” too, like “I should eat better” or “I should exercise more.” These “shoulds” may be exactly what you need, but because you are “should”-ing them and/or pushing them away and ignoring them, they can feel heavy and therefore need to be examined. And perhaps it’s not the eating or the exercising that’s actually the issue, but your core wounds that are keeping you from showing up for yourself—wounds you continue to ignore

---
> Personally, I soothe with food and always have. Shifting that pattern has been a continuous struggle throughout my life. I probably vaguely recognized that I was doing it in my thirties. Then I berated myself for doing it for another decade but still had no way to change it. Food became a conduit for reward and punishment, for defiance and control, and for comfort and happiness, too. And you can’t just stop eating altogether—food is necessary fuel!
> Simply knowing it was happening wasn’t leading me to a solution, in part because I wasn’t actively trying to solve the problem in a curious and open way. I was acknowledging the existence of the problem but was too overwhelmed to do anything about it other than what was socially acceptable—complaining, being self-deprecating, following crazy diet and exercise fads, sometimes being a little overweight, sometimes feeling bad about myself, sometimes not. But I certainly wasn’t looking for the cause of the issue. I’m not obese, I’d think, so how much of a problem is it really?
> W

---
> , if something is occupying a lot of your mental and physical energy, then it’s a problem whether it’s manifesting physically or not. And it’s going to keep you locked into a life of ongoing inner struggle and personal negativity if you don’t deal with it. After all, if you’re honest with yourself, you already know what those things are that plague you internally, even if you don’t know what to do about them

---
> I’m very good at being alone. I like to be still and silent. I am strong and self-sufficient, and I’m not easily bored. And at the same time, I sometimes isolate myself and then find it hard to connect with people. I don’t ask for help when I could really use it. I’m good at muscling through life, but I can become drained and exhausted by this

---
> Ask yourself what you can discover about you. Start small. What can you learn about yourself from your favorite TV shows? What can you learn about how you want to be in the world from how you run your business or how you interact with your coworkers

---
> Maybe your favorite TV shows reveal that you love to laugh and see the romantic side of life, that you prefer beautiful ideals and joyous endings

---
> But maybe this also reveals that you have a bit of an escapism practice. Maybe you struggle more with stressful, negative, real-life situations because they burst your bubble and really bring you down.

---
> At work, maybe you are organized and pleasant with everyone. You treat everyone with a certain amount of respect no matter where they are on the business hierarchy. You always clean up your dishes in the workroom and you occasionally bring in treats for your coworkers. How lovely! Now check out the alternative. Do you get annoyed when others don’t behave as you think they should? Do you in fact have an intolerance for messiness of any kind and judge people based on this? Have you developed a superiority complex with people because they aren’t as “good” as you are? How are your relationships because of it? Are they great on the surface as you play the nice guy but not very deep? Do you feel like you can’t just be yourself with all your warts and still be appreciated by everyone? Does the idea of being yourself mortify you

---
> Make a list. What are you good and bad at? Now, across from all the things on your list, try to write down what the strength and the weakness might be. For example, I am messy—but that also means I don’t need everything to be perfect in order to function well (some people are paralyzed by mess). Spend a moment to see what you can notice about what you deem to be your strengths and your weaknesses. Can you see that they are trails of information that lead you to a clearer picture of yourself? 

---
> We are making these efforts to dive deeply into identifying, understanding, and working on our true selves because without that knowledge and practice, we cannot grow closer to our full potential and attain our natural, essential nature.

---
> Think about it concretely. When you look at a simple algebra problem like 3 + x = 10, you cannot possibly solve for x without the other components. The answer is within the problem. It would be crazy for us to look at that math problem and start looking in the refrigerator for an answer. Yet this is what we do all day long. In particular, we do it by blaming others for our problems. That’s not to say people don’t stand in our way sometimes, but the solution is always in our own hands. Always. We just need to be more creative about how we look for the solutions that elude us.
> A

---
> As you investigate and stick with the problem, I encourage you to utilize the tool of journaling or writing as a way of tracking your discoveries and organizing your thoughts. Don’t just think your thoughts; write them down. Physically track what you love, what you’re curious about, your experiments, your ideas, your dreams

---
>  have come to discover through earnest personal experience and dedicated learning that ultimately the greatest help is self-help. There is no other help but self-help. Self-help comes in many forms: daily discoveries, honesty as we whole-heartedly do our best, indomitable dedication, and a realization that there is no end or limit because life is an ever-going proces

---
> If we want to look at how we practice all forms of rivalry, there are six diseases my father wrote about, all of which stem from the desire we have to win at all costs. These diseases rely on being in competition, which is typically where we go in a relationship the moment any discord pops up. When we relate to others in these ways, we are disconnecting from them and disconnecting from our true selves in order to access some form of outside validation. In other words, there is no relationship, no collaboration, no cocreation. There is only the victor and the loser

---
> There is no right or wrong. There is only “what is.” We don’t need to shame ourselves or beat ourselves up in the process of making ourselves “better,” nor should we shame and blame others to make ourselves feel better either. We need only observe, notice, and be curious about what is revealed through our responses and then choose how to move forward

---
> In looking at our “opponents,” we must not be afraid to uncover our true self and let that be seen. And in being comfortable enough in our own skin to be vulnerable and real, we suddenly begin allowing others the comfort of their true identities as well. If we do the work of understanding who we are, we will hold more and more to our core and see the opposing points of view more as complements rather than condemnations. Remember, opposites isolate us and create false distance. In reality, there is no distance—everything is connected like one fluid motion of a wave.

---
> Bruce Lee charted his progress. He set goals. He created reminders and exercises and tools for his growth—physically, mentally, and spiritually.

---
> But what he noticed was that while he was getting stronger, he was getting bulky bodybuilder muscles because of the types of exercise he was doing, and those were slowing him down in his martial arts techniques. He didn’t scrap weight lifting altogether, however. Rather, he made adjustments. He could see the benefits of the weights; he just had to incorporate them into his routine in a way that served his ultimate purpose and worked for him specifically. So he started to play around with lighter weights at higher reps and then moved on to isometric training (bringing the muscle to failure as quickly as possible) until he had a routine that yielded the results he was looking for—a strong, lean body that could react instantly.

---
> Knowing who you are, what you want, and what you love will serve you faithfully. And then, having clear objectives and clear dreams will set a direct trajectory from which you will not easily be deterred.

---
> Being clear can sometimes be half the battle. If you can’t feel the dream in your heart and see it in your mind’s eye, then it may not be your dream. It may be someone else’s. Your dream should excite and entice you. It should make all the hard work and potential struggle you are going to have to put into it worth it, because it is all yours

---
> Action begets more action. Even the laws of inertia back this up. Remember Newton? “An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion.” Be the object in motion

---
> We can start by getting clear about what it is we want to do, per the first tool. Take aim. And if we aren’t totally clear about the big places we want to go, then we can start by taking smaller actions (aka baby steps) toward the little things we know we want in order to ultimately get clear about the big picture

---
> You want to do something major with your life but you can’t even seem to keep your apartment clean? Then start by cleaning your apartment. Then what else is blocking your path? Go there next. No matter how silly or unrelated it may seem, handle the stuff that is bothering you. Build your confidence up so that you can take care of your business and solve your own problems

---
> There’s no shame in failure if you never tried in the first place, right? Unfortunately, you still have to live with yourself and inside yourself, and that stuck place can feel terrible. So instead let’s talk about a couple of things to help motivate us to take action toward the dreams in our hearts. As my father said, “In great attempts it is glorious even to fail.”

---
> When you notice you didn’t do what you wanted to do, then just give yourself a little pep talk and start again as if the past is, well, past. Every moment is a new moment to pick it back up and start again. Remember that practice doesn’t make us perfect; it makes us better. So stop attaching yourself to the results and just stay committed to the path. And when you stumble, pick yourself up and begin again.

---
> Memory
> Recognizing the value of an alert mind and an alert memory, I will encourage mine to become alert by taking care to impress it clearly with all thoughts I wish to recall and by associating those thoughts with related subjects which I may call to mind frequently

---
> Subconscious Mind
> Reorganizing the influence of my subconscious mind over my power of will, I shall take care to submit to it a clear and definite picture of my major purpose in life and all minor purposes leading to my major purpose, and I shall keep this picture constantly before my subconscious mind by repeating it daily!

---
> Imagination
> Recognizing the need for sound plans and ideas for the attainment of my desires, I will develop my imagination by calling upon it daily for help in the formation of my plans

---
> Emotion
> Realizing that my emotions are both positive and negative, I will form daily habits which will encourage the development of the positive emotions and aid me in converting the negative emotions into some form of useful action.

---
> Reason
> Recognizing that my positive and negative emotions may be dangerous if they are not guided to desirable ends, I will submit all my desires, aims, and purposes to my faculty of reason, and I will be guided by it in giving expression to these.

---
> Conscience
> Recognizing that my emotions often err in their over-enthusiasm, and my faculty of reason often is without the warmth of feeling that is necessary to enable me to combine justice with mercy in my judgments, I will encourage my conscience to guide me as to what is right and wrong, but I will never set aside the verdicts it renders, no matter what may be the cost of carrying them out.

---
> Willpower
> The power of will is the supreme court over all other departments of my mind. I will exercise it daily when I need the urge to action for any purpose, and I will form habits designed to bring the power of my will into action at least once daily.

---
> Another way to access the power of your affirmations is to write them down in a way that frames them as something you are in the process of, so that they feel more possible and more aligned with where you are right now. So instead of “I am strong and fit,” you could write, “I am working every day to be strong and fit.” This way you can still affirm what you want and feel authentically connected to it

---
>  The maximizing of one’s potential is not the tallying of accomplishments, but the continual engagement in life as a process of unlimited growth.

---
> All goals apart from the means are an illusion. There will never be means to ends, only means. And I am means. I am what I started with, and when it is all over, I will be all that is left of me. You can employ a systematic approach to training and practicing but never employ a method to living. Life is a process, not a goal; a means but not an end; a constant movement rather than an established pattern

---
> There is a concept in Buddhism called the Eightfold Path. It is usually presented something like this:
> Right View
> Right Purpose
> Right Speech
> Right Conduct
> Right Livelihood
> Right Effort
> Right Awareness
> Right Meditation

---
> dissolve them. My father bids us to cultivate “a mind that has no dwelling place but continues to flow ceaselessly and moves beyond our limitations and our distinctions.” We don’t stop having distinctions or feeling limited; we just decide not to let them control us. We stay consciously aware in the ceaseless interplay of life. We remove our mental blocks, our obsessive thoughts, our calculating mind, our need to be better than, our need to look good in front of, and we just are—unapologetically, sincerely, honestly, fully ourselves.

---
> From this masterful place, you no longer need to position yourself before you speak or act. You just speak or act with trust that you are being the most realized version of yourself in the moment of your action. All of our practicing is for this—a place where we no longer have to pause to analyze everything, where we no longer have to remember to pretend anything. As my father said, “The knowledge and skill you have achieved are, after all, meant to be ‘forgotten’ so you can float in emptiness comfortably, without obstruction.” Imagine what it would be like to move confidently and naturally in every situation. It would be the ultimate in personal power, freedom, and expression. What does it take to achieve this level of personal proficiency?

---
> When applying this stage to life, there’s no awareness when it comes to thoughts, emotions, and actions. We are operating in unskilled reactions to what we narrowly perceive as good or bad, right or wrong. When we get defensive and are unwilling to listen and consider another’s point of view or feelings, we are in partiality. 

---
> In this stage, we are open and engaged in learning and bettering ourselves

---
> In fluidity, we see that life is rich and varied and that there is not only one solution to every problem. We engage our many tools and develop more. We become creative and more expressive.

---
> In our martial arts analogy, when we’ve reached stage three, the stage of emptiness, a punch is, once again, just a punch—meaning we have now gotten to a place of so much honed skill that we no longer have to think about how to punch or all the components of a punch or even when to punch; now we can just punch. But this punch is a masterful punch—at once skillful and spontaneous

---
> The height of technique is to have no technique. Or, as in the Musashi quote, a course of immediate action is not to be reasoned out by theories or techniques on the art of war, but becomes the ability to make the right move in a split second without going through the process of thinking. The response just happens through a combination of wisdom and discipline that the warrior has attained

---
> How do we do this? Well, this is where the instruction manual needs to be written by you. Through all of your practice and discovery, you will have started to develop a sense of what works best for you

---
> This sense of freedom results from learning how to flow effortlessly in life. The effort we do apply is that of training, of working on ourselves so that more and more, we can become more whole and choose how we respond and participate in the rapid unfolding of life with a growing sense of ease. We get to stop overthinking so much and let naturalness become the norm. We’ve all had the experience where we just knew what to do or what to say in a given moment, and it felt so right and so natural, and there was an enthusiasm or easiness that permeated the whole exchange

---
> One way to look at it is in not second-guessing yourself once you’ve done a lot of good, solid personal practice. So, for example, when someone offers you a hand, you take it if that’s what you instantly feel. Or when someone asks you to do something that doesn’t feel right, you can simply say no, thank you. When someone offers you an opportunity (like sign this two-picture deal with an unproven new studio and producer in Hong Kong), you can sense immediately if it fits and you can say yes or no with full confidence.
> I

---
> Simple—be fully present, wise, and responsive in every moment. It’s just so hard to actually do! The idea is fairly easily conveyed, but to gain this simplicity in the doing feels challenging and like it may take an inordinate amount of practice.

---
> He became so adept at translating thought into action (helped by his martial arts practice) that it became second nature to him

---
> Now, of course, not all ideas are good ideas, but you get to the good ones faster if you move through the bad ones faster. The goal isn’t not to fail; the goal is to fail faster so that the lessons from the failures can be implemented and lead you to success more quickly

---
> I mean internally safe—feeling like you can trust yourself, take care of yourself, stand up for yourself, be okay no matter who you’re with or what’s happening, and be yourself without fear

---
> When your efforts become natural and purposeful, you don’t have to prove a point or position yourself or manipulate a situation or a relationship to be sure others think well of you. You may think that you do that stuff because it feels good and powerful and you’re being clever, but mostly you do it because you don’t feel good enough or powerful enough just as you are; and when you don’t feel good enough or powerful enough, you’re likely to feel unsure and inadequate and fearful—you feel unsafe.

---
> They work to nurture their own sense of internal security, which comes from working diligently to know themselves and make an ally out of change and the unknown. If you have the mental image of a warrior as someone who runs out bravely and determinedly into battle, translate that image instead into the image of someone who valiantly takes on whatever life throws at them with grace and determination, someone who doesn’t turn away from a challenge or from acknowledging their own shortcomings, someone who doesn’t seek just an ideal image but rather an ideal soul. That’s a modern-day warrior and a hero

---
> They don’t feel unsafe because they know they have the tools and the skills and the confidence to solve their own problems or to meet failure with grace; they know they are in cocreation with their life and all the lives around them

---
> To me this means that to obtain wholeness and full personal potential, we need to work not from the outside in, but from the inside out. We don’t need to spend all our time making the external stuff of our lives look a certain way so that we can then be joyful and peaceful and powerful. Instead we should work on being joyful, peaceful, and powerful and then bring that through into all the things we do and want and manifest in our lives

---
> In other words, don’t put all your focus and energy into your career so that one day you will be content and happy. Work on being content and happy and bring that into your career and the rest of your life

---
> Why is this the secret to nirvana? Because all the doubt, second-guessing, worry, analysis, judging, neediness, mask-wearing, and perfectionism that takes so much of our energy doesn’t exist here. Everything is immediate in this active emptiness, and it springs from the total sincerity of who we are. When we train to know ourselves, then we gain assuredness and confidence. In becoming our quintessential

---
> The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering

---
> Maybe, in the cultivation of you, you become someone who does what they say they are going to do, someone who is real and fully present, someone who is skilled because they have put time and effort into practicing something important to them, someone who has great energy that uplifts everyone they come into contact with. It doesn’t have to come with a name attached—such as greatest martial artist of all time, Nobel prize winner for literature, employee of the month, best mom ever. Remember, names create limitations. Those labels only describe one aspect of your total humanity. But if we have to have a name, then perhaps it can be “human, fully expressed.”
