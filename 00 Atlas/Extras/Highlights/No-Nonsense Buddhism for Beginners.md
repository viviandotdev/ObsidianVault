## No-Nonsense Buddhism for Beginners

## Highlights
From the Buddhist perspective, our perception of the reality of any situation (in this case, a car cutting us off) is influenced as much by ideas as it is by what actually happened. In this scenario, we might think, “This jerk cut me off!” But the idea that the other driver is a selfish, mean person who cut us off intentionally is a fictional narrative we created in our own mind. How do we know this person is a jerk? What if he or she just got devastating news and was distracted because of it? What if he or she was having a medical emergency? Would any of those scenarios alter the feelings you experienced in this scenario? Probably so. The reality of the situation is that a car cut you off, and that’s all you know. Everything else is uncertain; we don’t know who the driver is, why he or she behaved that way, or what is going on in that car.

In our day-to-day lives, we’re continually making meaning and creating stories about everything that happens. A thought arises, we create a story about it, the story evokes an emotion, we create another story about that, and on and on until, before we know it, we’re hardly paying attention to our lived reality at all, trapped in a habitual reactivity to our own thoughts.

--- 

But there is great freedom in releasing ourselves from the stories that cloud our perceptions and starting to feel okay with not always understanding the situation we’re in. This is why Buddhism is often referred to as the Path of Liberation. Liberation is the moment you don’t react to being cut off in traffic—because you don’t know what actually happened, so there’s nothing to react to. Liberation is experiencing reality as it is.

---
We see an inaccurate version of reality—a version, not coincidentally, that causes us unnecessary suffering. 

---
We tend to go through life thinking that external circumstances are to blame for our suffering and our lack of contentment.

---
This story symbolizes how Buddhists view the natural state of awareness, kindness, and compassion in us all. To see this inherent nature in ourselves and others, we have to peel away the clay—all the ideas, opinions, and beliefs that are preventing us from seeing how things really are.

---
There are also, however, some absolute or universal truths taught in Buddhism, and these are not bound by space and time or constructed by collective agreement. The Buddha taught that there are three universal characteristics of life, also known as the three marks of existence: dukkha (suffering), anicca (impermanence), and anattā (nonself). These three concepts form the core of what could be considered the truth in Buddhism.

---
Without dropping our labels and concepts completely, we loosen the death grip we have on them. When someone attacks a belief or opinion we hold, we can see that they’re attacking the idea, not us directly. When we’re non attached to our ideas, they no longer own us—we own them.

---
This is emptiness. It’s the understanding that as life unfolds, it doesn’t mean anything. It is neither positive nor negative. All things simply are as they are.

---
That pause allowed him to stop and see the reactivity that was unfolding. In that moment, the emotion of anger no longer had a grip on him. He was able to see the emotion and to allow it just to be. He was experiencing the emotion of anger, yes, but he was not reacting to it; he was never shot by the “second arrow” of suffering.

---
The problem arises in how we react to that suffering. The Buddha taught that “when touched with a feeling of pain, the ordinary uninstructed person sorrows, grieves, and laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. So he feels two pains, physical and mental.

---
E - Embrace the instance of suffering.
L- Let go of the reactive pattern
S - See the stopping of the reactivity.
A- Act skillfully

---
“What if I knew today was going to be my last day to live? How would that change my interactions with everyone I talk to today?” Then flip the question: “What if I knew that the person I’m talking to had only one more day to live? Would that change how I’m interacting with that person?”

---
Letting go of reactivity is letting go of the need to punch the wall, the need to react to our suffering in rage or despair that only creates more suffering when we have to, say, get stitches or repair a hole in the wall.

---
Do not try to use what you learn from Buddhism to be a Buddhist; use it to be a better whatever-you-already-are

---
Buddha about embracing suffering is that life is going to be easier for us when we truly accept that suffering is a part of life for everyone; there’s no way around it.

---
The Four Noble Truths are: the truth of suffering (dukkha), the truth of the cause of suffering (samudaya), the truth of the end of suffering (nirodha), and the truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering (magga)

---
But we can let go of our attachment to avoiding suffering, which paradoxically causes us so much avoidable suffering. This is a tricky concept to grasp,

---
From the Buddhist perspective, it’s not that we’re accepting the bad things that happen; we’re just accepting that bad things happen. Once I accept the reality of a situation, I can ask, “Now what am I going to do about it?” Acceptance is about working with reality, not against it.

---
Buddhism can be practiced somewhat like yoga: as something you do, not something you are.

---
Imagine walking into a barn, seeing a coiled hose, and mistaking it for a
snake. You wouldn’t be experiencing reality but rather the picture of reality in your head.

---
We must continually seek wisdom to help us learn to see the world as it really is

---
The next time you experience suffering or distress, instead of saying, “Life’s not fair” or, “Why is this happening to me?” tell yourself, “I was aware that this could happen. I’m not alone. Others are also experiencing this same thing.

---
Wisdom is like turning on the light in the barn and revealing that the snake is actually a hose.

---
Buddhism focuses on the questions themselves. It approaches the existential dilemmas of life by turning the question around and asking, “Why do I
want to know the answer to these questions?” or “Who is the ‘I’ who wants to know who I am?”

---
The goal of meditation isn’t to control our thoughts; it’s to observe them and become more familiar with the inner workings of our minds. Try it, and see what happens when you stop attempting to control your thoughts. Notice how thoughts, like all other things, are interdependent and impermanent. Thoughts arise, linger, and then dissipate or get replaced by other thoughts.
