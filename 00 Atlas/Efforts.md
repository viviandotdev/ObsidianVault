## Why "Efforts" are liberating
Thinking of your efforts as "efforts"—and not projects—is liberating and empowering because:

- **The definition is clear** 
    - Efforts require some sort of *effort*. When you tag a note as an effort, you are letting yourself know that some sort of effort is intended.
- **The definition is not too clear**
    - Efforts have _linguistic wiggle room_. Terms like "projects" are too narrow in scope to define the breadth of what an effort can be. This ambiguity is a feature, not a bug.

# How ideas and efforts play nicely together
The best way to understand "efforts" is to walk through an example of how "efforts" naturally support existing ideas.

For example, check out [[Sensemaking happens by triangulation]]. It started out as an idea I had. I wanted to better understand what "sensemaking" was and how it worked. 

- So I made a new note. 
- It was called "triangulation" 
- I looked up stuff and brushed up on the history of triangulation in navigation.
- Slowly, the note developed into a direction *I could not plan for ahead of time.*
- I adjusted the title to match what was growing within the note.
	- So "triangulation" became "Sensemaking through triangulation"
- I felt the spark of wanting to share this idea.
- ***That's when it became an effort!***
- That forced the title to change one more time.
	- So "Sensemaking through triangulation" became [[Sensemaking happens by triangulation]]. Yes, that's much stronger.
- Then I made it into a workshop lesson.
- Then I replaced it in the workshop because I wanted to get us more on hands-up repetitions.
- But I still liked the idea, so I rewrote it into a youtube video
- ...and a twitter thread
- ...and later I even rewrote it for my newsletter
- ...and later, I want to get it up on my website.
- ...and always, I have this treasure to fuel my own thinking.
- That's the power of thinking in "efforts" and not projects.

Go back to the first bullet. Can you imagine if tried to call this a "project". A project of what?! I didn't even know what I was trying to do! It would have smothered my spark of curiosity and replaced it with feelings of guilt for not completing it—whatever "it" was. 

> It was only because I eventually framed this note as an "effort" that I benefitted from the space to breath with the idea and allow it to grow into one of my favorite ideas!

Had I been worried about some sort of project-driven output, with a hard deadline, this idea would have never evolved to what it has now become.

This is the power of "efforts" over "projects" when it comes to developing your ideas.

# What are the big differences between efforts and projects?
Here are the 3 biggest differences between "efforts" and "projects":

### Efforts don’t force a top-down mindset
A top-down mindset will suffocate ideas. When we worked on assembly lines and in big corporate offices, projects made sense because order and linearity reigned. But today, more and more of us are working with ideas, and ideas need room to grow, evolve, and have a chance to fully form into whatever they might be becoming. 

> Efforts are freeing.

### Efforts don’t need a deadline
Projects require deadlines. But efforts are flexible, fluid, and adaptable. They can have no deadlines, hard deadlines, soft deadlines—and likely various deadlines for various versions of the same idea outputted to different mediums in different final forms. 

> Efforts are fluid.

### Efforts don’t have a clear size

They can be bigger than projects, or smaller, and oftentimes their size is hard to know. I’m writing a book. That’s a single effort with probably over 100 projects. Am I really going to make it into 100 projects and track them all? With an "efforts-mindset" I don't have to. 

Instead, efforts and projects work in tandem: a smaller project organically spins out of a larger effort. I can tackle the project, and then confidently refocus on the larger effort. 

> Efforts are expandable.
