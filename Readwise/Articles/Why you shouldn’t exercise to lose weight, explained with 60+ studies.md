## Highlights
- xercise accounts for a small portion of daily calorie burn ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqzj9zky4wxkq80er4492rc))
- There are three main components to energy expenditure, Kravitz explained: 1) basal metabolic rate, or the energy used for basic functioning when the body is at rest; 2) the energy used to break down food; and 3) the energy used in physical activity.

- he basal metabolic rate accounts for 60 to 80 percent of total energy expenditure," Kravitz said. Digesting food accounts for about 10 percent.
  That leaves only 10 to 30 percent for physical activity, of which exercise is only a subset.

- our bodies may actively fight our efforts to lose weight. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqzbw5pdppj52mnpnkw38n4))
- "constrained model" of energy expenditure, which shows that the effect of more physical activity on the human body is not linear. In light of our evolutionary history — when food sources were less reliable — he argues that the body sets a limit on how much energy it is willing to expend, regardless of how active we are.

- The calorie restriction groups lost more weight than the group that both dieted and exercised.
  If you embark on a weight loss journey that involves both adding exercise and cutting calories, Montclair's Thomas warned not to count those calories burned in physical activity toward extra eating. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfqz9q0s1hadw6my255dxk54))
