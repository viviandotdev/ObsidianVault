[[Why am I introverted]]
### Why don't I feel lonely?
- I have felt more lonely around other people than when I'm alone.
- The most lonely period of my life was high school.
- I never get bored because I have so many questions, books I want to read, and things I want to build and learn. I get confused when people say they are bored.
- The immense computational power and energy required to develop semi-intelligent systems like ChatGPT are staggering. Yet, our brains naturally possess incredible cognitive capabilities, which we often take for granted. Instead of harnessing this potential, many people spend their time mindlessly scrolling through TikTok or watching TV, allowing their brains to atrophy rather than using them to their fullest extent.

### Why I quit social media
- I don't feel FOMO because I know I wouldn't want to be in those situations. If you show me someone having fun at a party, I don't feel FOMO because I know I wouldn't have fun there.
- Social media tells you what to like, think, and feel, but I want to figure these things out naturally. I want to know what I'll become interested in on my own.

### How do you value money?
- I want to spend as little time thinking about money as possible.
- I want to build apps not to make a lot of money but because I enjoy it. I'm lucky to have found something I'm good at and enjoy, so why not spend more time doing it?
- The goal is to continue building apps that I think are cool and that others will use. Salaries and money are byproducts of ambition, not the primary desire.
- It's not that I don't care; I just don't want to fight. I know how things will be, and I'll end up getting hurt, so I give up and let you win. I'm scared of making you upset and will do anything to prevent that.
- I usually don't spend much money


### [[Which attachment style are you?]]




### What do you think is most important: health, time, or money?
- I think one of the keys to living a good life is optimizing for health, time, and money.


  
### Why i love to rock climb?
If the person that’s supposed love me the most doesn’t even believe in me or encourage me to do well how can I supposed to believe in myself.
I had such low self-esteem, I doubted my self so much and the people who were supposed to love me the most did not make it any easier. 

Like I see it with my brother, like the other day he told me he wanted to a piano so he practice a song he liked,

I told him he could have mine, and my mom and sister said don’t give to him it’s a waste of time he’s just going to practice for 2 days and then give up, I was the only trying to encourage, like I as showing him songs like.

Also like I recently got him to start cooking and he cooked fried rice and it came out mushy, granted it was my fault because I thew in the vegetables in after he cooked it, but that was because he wasn't going to put any in and wanted vegetables.
My sister looked at it and said I could even mess it up if i tried.
Then my mom throws out the leftovers when I wanted to eat it,
Like how do you expect anyone to be good if you don't encourage them.
I've learned to not listen to them when they see things, like they doubt me all the fucking time it actually so annoying. Like how many times do I have to prove them wrong for them to believe in me.

Like when I got my job I didn't have anyone to tell, 
### What makes me happy
- eating sushi 
- toping out on a difficult bouldering
- eating good food with friends
- watching devil's plan
