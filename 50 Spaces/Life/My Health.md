**Goals** -This one is _simple_:
- Lose weight
- Gain strength
- Make is sustainable
My weight fluctuates between 110- 120 usually hovering around 110- 113 for most the the year. over the winter it is on the high end and over the summer it moves a little toward the lower end. 
I want the feeling of lightness and energy losing some weight will bring me. 
Strength is a just a side of effect of losing weight, when I am **lighter I feel more energetic and want to do the exercises.** The exercises become easier when I lighter.
