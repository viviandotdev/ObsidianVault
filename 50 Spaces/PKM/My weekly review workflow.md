[The Weekly Review: A Productivity Ritual to Get More Done](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/weekly-review)


1. Prioritizing (1-2 important tasks of the day)
	- what would my future version of me be the most thankful for if i did it today?
	- **Creating generous time blocks** (always overestimate the amount of time to do something is better than underestimating)
2. Fill gaps will other tasks to optimize flow state
3. Schedule break time at the end of the day (after 7pm no coding at all)
