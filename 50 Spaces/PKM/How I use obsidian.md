### Daily time block for writing
- Start off your mornings with reading and taking notes
- I'm going to bring that habit back by spending an hour after my morning routine to partake in some deep work to explore my curiosities.

### Throughout the day, log anything significant that comes to mind
- After each work period create a daily note to log everything you did and then sub-bullets for details

### At the end of the day do some house keeping of your notes
