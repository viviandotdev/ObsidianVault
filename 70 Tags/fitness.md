**Goals** -This one is _simple_:
- Lose weight
- Gain strength
- Make is sustainable
My weight fluctuates between 107 - 115 usually hovering around 110- 113 for most the the year. over the winter it is on the high end and over the summer it moves a little toward the lower end. 
I want the feeling of lightness and energy losing some weight will bring me. 
Strength is a just a side of effect of losing weight, when I am **lighter I feel more energetic and want to do the exercises.** The exercises become easier when I lighter. 

Prioritize consistency 

- [x] **Pistol Squat**
- [ ] Pull up



**current workout** 
inverted row (18)
squat (3)
side bend (16)
incline row  (17.5)
push up (12)
side kick (10)
run (zone 2) (3 minutes)

it is important to find and collect workouts that you like so you actually do them. i like focusing on trying to acquire skills. working out is more enjoyable when I feel that I am making progress on doing something that I could not do before.
setting skill goals seems to make me want to work out more.
