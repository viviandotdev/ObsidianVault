## self-improvement


**Bias towards action**, your [[system]] should allow to get to working on the project as quick as possible not spending all your time planing and organizing.
For example spend more time building a notion page rather than actually progressing toward their goals, all of these things are a type of procrastination and prevent you doing what you actually want to do.
