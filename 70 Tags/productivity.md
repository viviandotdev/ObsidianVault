- make a lot of lists
	- make lists of what I want to accomplish each year, each month, and each day
	-  Lists are very focusing, if you are not in the mood of a something you can always find something exciting from that list

&gt;I like to start and end each day with something I can really make
&gt;progress on.

&gt;recommend using lists.  I make lists of what I want to accomplish each
&gt;year, each month, and each day.  Lists are very focusing, and they help me
&gt;with multitasking because I don’t have to keep as much in my head.  If I’m not in the mood for some particular
&gt;task, I can always find something else I’m excited to do.
