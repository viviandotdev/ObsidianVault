> Connect your new MOC with the the rest of your network of knowledge so you can *navigate your notes near the speed of thought*.

> Enjoy the spatial constellation you created. Your MOCs will be meaningful to you.

> - as a reference point in the future, as a navigational hub
> - for the inherent joy the ideas provide.

> As you finish work on an area of interest, the MOC remains as a renewable summation of thought for the future you. An MOC is your easy access point back into the topic—whether that's tomorrow or in ten years.
