Have a place to honor the importance of the people your life.

Once you feel comfortable, adding notes for peopleâ€”whether they are living or notâ€”you will notice how it helps your understanding of them. Here are the main things I do related to notes on people:

- Make note of special memories
- Jot down notable information
- Learn entirely new industries
- Learn more about people
