# 3sum-closest

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return *the sum of the three integers*. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution. 

Example 1: ``` **Input:** nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2). ``` Example 2: ``` **Input:** nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0). ``` **Constraints:** - `3 4 4`
