But is there anything else? When I ask that, the answer that pops up is _Make good new things_.

The most impressive thing humans can do is to think. It may be the most impressive thing that can be done. And the best kind of thinking, or more precisely the best proof that one has thought well, is to make good new things.

Indeed, trying to express what you understand is not just a way to prove that you understand it, but a way to understand it better.

So there's my guess at a set of principles to live by: take care of people and the world, and make good new things. Different people will do these to varying degrees.
