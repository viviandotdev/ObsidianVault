finite games have an end, the goal of the game is to win.
infinite games have not end, the goal of the game is to continue playing.

example:
In the reflection video by the sublime founder[[2025 Founder Recap State of Sublime]], she discusses how ==most start-ups have an exit strategy, they build a product so that eventually it can be bought out by one of the big tech companies.==
However, her perspective for building sublime is "to get to a place where sublime could exist indefinitely.” 
She wants to build something that could last forever

This is the same perspective i want to adopt when building things as well.
I don't build them to sell it someone so that I could make a lot of money, I build it because I want to it to exist and work on kelp
