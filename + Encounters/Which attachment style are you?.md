## Which attachment style are you?

[[avoidant vs anxious attachment]]

**Suppression of Emotion**
As a child expressing emotions, whether joy or sadness, was often met with punishment or dismissal. Examples include being yelled at for laughing loudly or crying, which taught you to suppress your feelings. This led to a belief that emotions were a source of trouble, and you learned to avoid them to cope. **This suppression seems to have made it difficult to be vulnerable and communicate openly in relationships as an adult.**  I couldn't express myself the way I wanted, only in a way that fit how my mom wanted me to represent her.

**Inconsistent and Unresponsive Parenting**
You've highlighted several instances of inconsistent and emotionally unresponsive parenting. You mentioned feeling emotionally abandoned, especially by your dad, **who was often absent for important events.** The inconsistency of being loved one moment and criticized the next was confusing and created an environment where you felt it was unsafe to share your hopes and dreams. This also extended to your physical needs, such as your freezing room in the winter, which were ignored.

**Attachment and Relationships**
These early experiences appear to have shaped your attachment style. You related your feelings of being "abandoned" immediately after birth to your struggles with forming close, secure relationships and your difficulty trusting others. You identified with an avoidant attachment style, noting how you might push people away to prevent being abandoned yourself. This also connects to your observations about your parents' poor communication and lack of respect for each other's opinions, which didn't provide a healthy model for you to learn from.

**Long-Term Effects**
 * Difficulty managing emotions or feeling a heightened sensitivity to stress.
 * A sense of emotional numbness, where you feel no pain, which you believe is a coping mechanism.
 * A feeling of not being close to your parents or anyone else.
 * A belief that you must figure everything out yourself because no one will help you.


**Early Separation and Attachment**
You believe your attachment issues stem from being raised by your aunts instead of your parents during crucial early years. You feel this period is essential for brain development and forming deep connections, and you believe you missed out on that "wiring." This has led to a feeling of being emotionally disconnected from your parents, to the point where you could live your life without them.
**The Feeling of Something Missing**
You have a strong sense that a part of your brain or emotional self is missing. While you don't know exactly what this is, you are certain something isn't right. This feeling of an emotional void is a key part of your struggle, and it is a direct result of your early childhood experiences.
**A Desire to Reconnect**
Despite these challenges, you express a desire to "remake those connections." This shows an awareness that these issues can be addressed. However, you are unsure how to begin this process, which highlights a feeling of being lost or uncertain about the path forward. Your fear of losing relationships is also a strong indicator that you want to form secure connections, even if you don't know how to do so yet.
