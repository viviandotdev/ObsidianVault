## Intrinsic motivation is the result of commitment rather than passion

**Common Problems**
People that motivation comes from passion, people believe that passion is what truly motivates people to be so successful
However what creates motivation is actually commitment, just by simply committing to something long enough you will build the motivation to do it more
Most people are too busy trying to many different things and never reach a point where they get good enough at something for it to become their passion

**Personal Experience**
I don't think I am passionate about coding
One of the main reasons I do it is because I enjoy, in addition I have already commited so much time into it I was to continue and get better.
