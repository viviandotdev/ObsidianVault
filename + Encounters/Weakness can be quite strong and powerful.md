People with an inferiority complex can use this to their advantage.
They use their misfortune to their advantage, and try to control the other party with it. By declaring how unfortunate they are and how much they have suffered, **they are trying to worry the people around them (their family and friends, for example), and to restrict their speech and behaviour, and control them**.

‘In fact, if we were to ask ourselves who is the strongest person in our culture, the logical answer would be the baby. The baby rules and cannot be dominated.’ The baby rules over the adults with his weakness. And it is because of this **weakness that no one can control him.**


You don’t understand how I feel’—are likely to contain a certain degree of truth. Completely understanding the feelings of the person who is suffering is something that no one is capable of. **But as long as one continues to use one’s misfortune to one’s advantage in order to be ‘special’, one will always need that misfortune.**
