## avoidant vs anxious attachment

avoidant attachment we fear abandonment, so to protect ourselves we choose to keep people at a distance  
- values independence
- discomfort with emotional intimacy
- view emotional expression as weakness
- self sufficient and independence 
- Avoidant attachment style
	- push people away and keep them at a distance
	- it is makes it easier to cut them off or cope better if they abandon them
