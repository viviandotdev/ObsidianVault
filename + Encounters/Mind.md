don't confuse gratitude with contentment, gratitude is appreciating what I have and what I will receive, where as contentment is the satisfactions with one's current circumstance. However I think I used contentment as an excuse to be lazy and not want to pursue more.
Contentment as an Excuse:
1. Used to avoid challenges or personal growth
2. Becomes a justification for not setting or pursuing goals3.May mask fear of failure or change .Can lead to stagnation and missed opportunities

**values**
- if you tell someone to do something and they do it wrong or badly do you think it's your fault or their fault?
	- i would think it is my fault, if you want something done well do it yourself, don't blame them if they do it badly obviously they do it badly because they just don't care enough 
- if you are suffering or going through something difficult would you want to share that burden with them or would you want to protect them from it?
	- i would think it is a burden to unload that trauma on to them


i will say stuff to you and but take everything people say with a grain of salt, not everything i tell you will be true to you, but i was true for me based on my experience and my short life so far, you don't and shouldn't listen to and follow everything I say and do because even if you did you would not end up in my same position because there is just too many variables. Most of the things I tell you will not even work for or you just think is wrong, that is good, you should learn how to think for yourself. All I can do is tell you want I did and worked for me, you have the responsibility to take that information and applying to your situation and your life. we are not supposed to live the same life anyways, you will have your own path.
