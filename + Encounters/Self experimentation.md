## Self experimentation

Life is about change and **figuring out how you can change for the better,**

Change is achieved through self-experimentation, where you discover what works for you 


**Potential Framework, System, or Solution**
- Create an document listing all of your experiments and thing you want to try to do
- Experiments are like 30 days challenges or 1 week challenges.
- You should implement more of these experiments in your life
