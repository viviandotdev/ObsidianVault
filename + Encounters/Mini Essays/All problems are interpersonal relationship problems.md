[[The Courage to be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi Fumitake Koga]]

what do you mean by this?


all problems are interpersonal relationships problems,
every single problem you have is based on your interpersonal relationships

what are interpersonal relationships,
they are the relationships you have with your siblings and your parents,
separation of tasks


if there was no one else in the world you would not have any problems

**types of interpersonal relationship problems**
**inferiority complex**
**because you are short you feel inferior to others**, this arose from comparing yourself to others, if you lived in a world by yourself with no one to compare to this would not be a problem for you.
this feeling being inferior is a subjective interpretation not an objective fact.

**thinking that you are not educated so you cannot succeed**
- my mother has this inferioirty complex and projects this on to to me which is why she always says i cannot do this.'


**power struggle**


**superiority complex**
