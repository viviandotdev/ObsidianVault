[[The Courage to be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi Fumitake Koga]]

what do you mean by this?


all problems are interpersonal relationships problems,
every single problem you have is based on your interpersonal relationships

what are interpersonal relationships,
they are the relationships you have with your siblings and your parents,
separation of tasks


if there was no one else in the world you would not have any problems

**types of interpersonal relationship problems**
**inferiority complex**
problem->**because you are short you feel inferior to others**, this arose from comparing yourself to others, if you lived in a world by yourself with no one to compare to this would not be a problem for you.
this feeling being inferior is a subjective interpretation not an objective fact.

problem->**thinking that you are not educated so you cannot succeed**
- my mother has this inferioirty complex and projects this on to to me which is why she always says i cannot do this.'

**superiority complex**

**power struggle**
when one thinks that they are right, this creates a power struggle, where they have the 
desire to be right which means the other person must be wrong.
**problem** arise when you try to make the other person be wrong

**seeking recognition from others**
when you seek recognition for others, you care about how others judge so you are living the lives of other people. 
**you should not live to act in the way other people expect you to.**
**live and act in the way that you want to.**
it is not selfish to not live up to other people's expectations and you should not expecv other people to live up to your expectations.
**problems** and resentment arise when people do not live up your expectations. 


**separation of tasks**
do not intrude on other people's tasks and don't let other people intrude of your own

studying is the child's task not the parent's task,
when the parent tries to intrude on a child's task it seems like they are doing it for the good of the child but actually they are doing so to fullfill their own goals, such as appearance in the eyes of the socieity, the child who sees this deception will want ot rebe
**problems** arise when intruding on other people's task and when other people intrude on your tasks

how do you know whose task is this?
answer the question who is ultimately going to recieve the end result brought about by the choice that is made?

not intruding does not mean non-interernence, you should not meddle in the child's task to study but should let them know that you are ready to assist them when they are ready to study. this create the sepration of tasks and forms horizontal relationships, instead of commanding from above that the child must study, they can gain confidence and have trust in that the child will take care of their studies on their own

**resolving interpersonal relationships problems**
- the cards to resolve these problems are within your hands
- in freudian aetiologiy, there is a cause an effect, 
	- my father hit me as a child therefore our relationship is bad
- alderian teleophy flips this
	- i brought out the emory of being hit because i don't want to fix my relationships with my father.
- i have the power to change the goal to make steps to resolve the issue, most people think that to resolve these interpersonal relationship problems is it up to the other person, however you can have agency over improving your relationships.

**if interpersonal relationships cause problems what the point of having interpersonal relationships?**
- community feeling is the goal of interpersonal relationships. what can you give to this person
- to create community feeling your interpersonal relationships should be horizontal relationships not vertical relationshiops
- in **vertical** relationships feelings of inferiority rises,
	- words of judegemnt create vertical relationshios, 
	- commanding others creates vertical relationhisp
	- words or praise creates vertical relationshios
- in **horizontal** relationships, equal but not the same there is no room for an inferiority complex to emerge
	- words gratitude convey horizontal relationships
	- words of respect and joy
**just exist**
- your mother in critical condition is just by
