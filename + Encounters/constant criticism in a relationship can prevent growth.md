## constant criticism in a relationship can prevent growth

My sister is always constantly correcting the smalles things that I. dor,

Grow I received constant criticism within my family
- Makes you feel small
- Exhaustion from being judged can actually lead to [[procrastination]]
	- I feel that I often don't let my self do things because I don't want to deal with the criticism that will come
	- I don't want to say I want to do this or that because they are just going to say you can't

Constant criticism will not help you grow or change
Real growth comes from self corrections that form
