## constant criticism in a relationship can prevent growth

My sister is always constantly correcting the smallest things that I do. Attacking a person's character rather than addressing the specific behavior
	For example, instead of saying "I'm upset that you didn't take out the trash," a criticism might be "You're so lazy and inconsiderate." 

For example she is always correcting for the smallest things like
- Leaving the light one
- Not closing the door correctly
- Not cleaning the dishes clean enough
- Not making my bathroom clean

Grow I received constant criticism within my family
- Makes you feel small
- **Exhaustion from being judged** can actually lead to [[procrastination]]
	- I feel that I often don't let my self do things because I don't want to deal with the criticism that will come
	- I don't want to say I want to do this or that because they are just going to say you can't

Constant criticism will not help you grow or change
Real growth comes from self corrections that form
Rather than someone constantly watching over you and commenting and correcting  your every move
