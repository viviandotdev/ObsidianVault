*your writing needs to solve other people’s problems first and foremost if you want people to read your work.*

Look at 5-10 creators talking about topics you want to write about. I have my own list that includes lots of different niches. I like to see my own brand as a mix of each one.

Study their 3-5 highest-performing posts. Don’t watch them or read them. Just study the titles. Look for patterns, repeating words across titles, and question why the structure works.

My newsletters follow a **Problem → Insight → Solution** structure.

I absorbed these sources while making food or going on walks, brainstorming the topic of “how to write” while looking for my own unique perspective.
