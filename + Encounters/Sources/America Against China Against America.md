On one hand, he noticed how technology can increase social alienation and a materialistic “money first” attitude. But he also considered how it may tame an unruly society more effectively than law:


This is a core belief shared by modern China and Silicon Valley alike: ***Who wins in technology, wins the world.***

“Do you guys worry about AI safety?” “We don’t think about risks at all.”
> Contrast to america people are constantly worried about AI safety and talk about, i think China sees it more as a tool however in the US we use terms like building a God, we add a religious context to it.

Chinese engineers also seem more practical than their American counterparts. They’re here to build tech and make money; risk management is for bureaucrats; policy is only relevant insofar as it helps or hurts your work. This is something I think Westerners often get wrong. If you live in a single-party state, you are, on average, *less* ideological yourself. The politics have already been decided—no point wasting extra cycles coming up with something new.
> Chinese people are generally less political because they live in a single party state, they can move faster because they don't waste extra cycles coming up with something new.
> Because of the polarizing 2 party system, we literally waste time each each year just undoing the work of the previous party causing us to be stagnant

China also has its own version of tall poppy syndrome, but in its case, the state wields the shears—Jack Ma being the key example. Idioms like 树大招风 (tall trees catch more wind) and 人怕出名猪怕壮 (people fear fame, pigs fear getting fat) warn the dangers of speaking up or standing out. These norms, my mom theorizes, are one reason that Chinese have not been as successful as Indian Americans in ascending American corporate hierarchies.

have also started creating “third places” and hosting “life-story salons,” writes

*This is a sign of a rich country: China is summiting Maslow’s hierarchy.*

Someone once told me that China is the best place in the world to be a consumer. You can see such innovation shine brightest in the tea-drinking accoutrements: disposable cups for cold-brew that filter out leaves, carrier handles for take-out cups, flavors like Manner’s “osmanthus longjing latte” that actually taste good. Urban hubs feature other exotic conveniences too: battery packs on every block that you can rent for $0.75 an hour and drop off wherever, tiny electric fans to relieve you from 100 degree August days, LED screens in form factors that the West has never seen—building facades, foldable phones, and smart glasses much lighter weight than the Vision Pro.

But a substantial component is sheer fascination, and a solipsistic desire to understand China so that I might better understand America and myself.

Expats there are all addicted to the pace of change; everywhere else is slow in comparison. It’s the same reason I love San Francisco, for all its thorns—China is a place where *things actually* *happen*.
