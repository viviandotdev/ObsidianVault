> Party committee members to hold regular meetings called democratic life meetings, during which they analyze their actions and areas for improvement through self-inspection and self-criticism

> In the United States, large organizations such as unions, YMCA, and United Way are independent. But in China, the party manages everything.
> These nongovernment agencies are managed as government entities under the party

> China is the only major country that has not engaged in any warfare in the past four decades

> To avoid nepotism, in Chinese politics, a city’s leader is usually not from the area. This has been the practice for thousands of years

> Corruption was an effective means for getting around cumbersome bureaucracy.
> Fighting corruption has been Xi Jinping’s signature move

> Each level of Chinese government includes a department called the grievance agency. When people believe they have been mistreated.
> They can line up at the agency’s door to have their voices heard.
> This is different from a court, where the adversary system exists

> Government intervention is based on the belief that the good of society takes priority over an individual’s welfare. Again, this concept can be traced back to Confucius’s political philosophy.

> The average income level in China is still only about 20 percent of that in the United States, and yet the average levels of education and health of the population are not too far away from those in the United States

> But would never implement such a policy because it would set a bad example of pleasing the poor at the expense of long-term public investment

> My generation went to the United States and other Western countries as students at a time when China was “closed.”
> Everything in the West seemed miraculous to us, and we thought China would never be able to catch up in its social and economic development.
> We believed that everything in the United States was much better than in China.

> This is why most of the Chinese dynasties of the past two thousand years were not expansionary.

> In Chinese philosophy, one has to push for economic growth first; political development will come later as a consequence of a higher quality of life.

> High-tech companies such as Huawei began working on a contingency plan that they internally referred to as the “spare tire,” intending to establish their own operating systems and computer chips just in case the United States were to cut them out of the computer technology ecosystem.

> For the past five hundred years, most wars were fought among Western nations.

> A theory called the Thucydides Trap:
> When a new power rose, the incumbent power felt challenged and as a consequence, wars between the new and the incumbent powers broke out.
> When China grows bigger and stronger, China will face pushback from the United States.
