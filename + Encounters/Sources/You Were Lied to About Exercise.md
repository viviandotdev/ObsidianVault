Since then, exercise has largely been reduced to mere calorie burning.

On the flip side, though, you can simply move more, or with more intensity—the more movement you get, the more calories you burn, thus increasing the deficit.

**doesn’t really work that way.**

What he found was shocking:

At a certain point, energy expenditure plateaus: people with extremely active lives burn about the same as those with moderately active lives.

biological processes 
cellular communication-
cells become more sensitive and responsive to insulin allowing glucose to enter more easily, it reduce inflammatory signaling and enhances mitochondrial function, 
Stronger mitochondria = more cellular energy with less waste, which = less fatigue, less brain fog, faster recovery, and slower aging.

**hormone regulation**
When you move, contract, and build muscle, it releases signaling molecules—called myokines—that reduce inflammation, improve brain function, help regulate mood, metabolism, and immune response.

**brain function**
Movement increases Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)—essentially Miracle Grow for neurons—which promotes neuroplasticity (making the brain more adaptable), increases neurogenesis (the growth of new neurons) to support memory and learning, regulates mood through modulating serotonin and dopamine, and shields neurons from oxidative stress.

This subset of people is probably the most likely to hurt themselves. They’re still largely sedentary throughout most of their days, then overtraining, going too hard in the gym, not using proper periodization, or giving the body enough rest, leaving their bodies ill-equipped to handle the sudden high demand.

They’re sitting on the floor, kneeling, stooping, and squatting.

The ability to easily get up and down off the ground (without hand assistance) is a near-perfect litmus test for your body’s overall functionality.
