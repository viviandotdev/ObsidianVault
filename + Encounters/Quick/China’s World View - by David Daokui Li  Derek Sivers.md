> Every village has a party committee, every department of a university has a party branch, and even factories have a party branch.
&gt;Party committee members to hold regular meetings called democratic life meetings, during which they analyze their actions and areas for improvement through self-inspection and self-criticism

&gt;These nongovernment agencies are managed as government entities under the party

>
> China is the only major country that has not engaged in any warfare in the past four decades

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Oct 19 2025 15:39:19 GMT-0400
>
> To avoid nepotism, in Chinese politics, a city’s leader is usually not from the area. This has been the practice for thousands of years

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Oct 19 2025 15:39:19 GMT-0400
>
> Corruption was an effective means for getting around cumbersome bureaucracy.

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Oct 19 2025 15:39:19 GMT-0400
>
> Each level of Chinese government includes a department called the grievance agency. When people believe they have been mistreated.
&gt;They can line up at the agency’s door to have their voices heard.
&gt;This is different from a court, where the adversary system exists

> Government intervention is based on the belief that the good of society takes priority over an individual’s welfare. Again, this concept can be traced back to Confucius’s political philosophy. On the global stage, the American political philosophy sits at one extreme, placing great emphasis on individual liberty.
&gt;Social stability and economic prosperity are more important than ensuring individual rights

>
> In China, to sell a product on the market, the producer often must first gain approval from the government by passing a standard.
&gt;In the United States, producers can often begin selling immediately without approval, but if the product is later believed to be unsafe, the producer may face lawsuits.

>

&gt;China’s product standards are often among the world’s highest.

&gt;Manufacturers send their best samples for inspection, later assembling substandard products for volume production.

>
> State-owned enterprises are enterprises in which the government holds the largest number of shares

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Oct 19 2025 15:39:19 GMT-0400
>
> These SOEs include China Mobile, Bank of China, China Unicom, China Telecom, Construction Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Oct 19 2025 15:39:19 GMT-0400
>
> Confucian values place businessmen among society’s lowest classes.

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Oct 19 2025 15:39:19 GMT-0400
>
> Deeply rooted in Confucian doctrine: parents and children are bonded for life.
&gt;A successful child is obliged to take care of their parents and grandparents.
&gt;This is why their children’s education is the most important investment a family can make to ensure long-term prosperity.

> [!quote]+ Updated on Sun Oct 19 2025 15:39:19 GMT-0400
>
> The average income level in China is still only about 20 percent of that in the United States, and yet the average levels of education and health of the population are not too far away from those in the United States
