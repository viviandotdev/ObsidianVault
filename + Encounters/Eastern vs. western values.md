**I terms of values I am a mix between eastern and western values**
equality vs hierarchy
- For relationships, I values equality in relationships, I prefer peer relationships, I don't like interacting people who don't see me as a peer
collectivism vs individualism
- I think this is more difficult for me to decide, I think at my core I am more individual, I think for my own happiness and peace
