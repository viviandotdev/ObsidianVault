**I terms of values I am a mix between eastern and western values**
equality vs hierarchy
- For relationships, I values equality in relationships, I prefer peer relationships, I don't like interacting people who don't see me as a peer
collectivism vs individualism
- I think this is more difficult for me to decide, I think at my core I am more individual, I think for my own happiness and peace inidividualim is more important to me.
- However I can see the benefits of collectivism but I think it also can create trauma where i feel i need to sacrifice my happiness to my others happy which will make me happy?
- This is impossible because that is not within your control, no matter what you do the other person may never be satisfied so what is the point of trying to satisfy them?
- Isn't it better to put your energy towards what is meaningful to you and satisfying your own wants and desires? 
direct vs in-direct communication
- I think direct communication is healthier than in-direct communication
