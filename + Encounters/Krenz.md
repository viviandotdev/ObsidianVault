**basic perspective**
-  **how are the basic 1, 2 and 3 point perspective formed?**
	- 1 point - look directly at the object at eye level
	- vertical and horizontal axis has no convergence
	- 2 points -> rotating the block in 1 axis
	- now x and y converge
	- 3 point - rotating the previous cube again on another axis
		- looking up or down creates 3 point perespective


- what is the perspective in a scene?
	- ![[Pasted image 20251216142719.png]]
	- entire scene cannot be categorized as signle pserpsective system (NEVER think that 1 scene can **only have** 1 type of perspecitve)
	- each objecet should be treated differentely
	- every object occupies it own space, the space may have it's own perspective to the caemra
	- look at each object and its relation to the caemra, whether its facing the camera, below, above or rotated at what axis
		- if it directly facing you it is 1 point if 
		- it is only rotated in horizontal axis it is 2 point
		- it is rotated more than horizontal axis it is 3
**line work**
- do not hatch each line multiple lines
	- create larges margin of error and in the end your perspective will be complete off
	- these small errors will lead to large errors,
	- each perspective calculation is based on the accuracy of the previous, the errors build on top of each other quickly
- use wrist to draw short lines
- user shoulders to draw long lines

**drawing a building from ref**
1. identify the perspective of the building
	- draw lines through the object in ref
	- here the ref is close to 2 point
	- although it is not at eye level, it is still within our eye's vision and we don't need to tilt our head down to see it
