-  **how are the basic 1, 2 and 3 point persp formed?**
	- 1 point - look directly at the object at eye level
	- vertical and horizontal axis has no convergence
	- 2 points -> rotating the block in 1 axis
	- now x and y converge
	- 3 point - rotating the previous cube again on another axis
		- looking up or down creates 3 point perespective


- what is the perspective in a scene?
	- entire scene cannot be categorized as signle pserpsective system (NEVER think that 1 scene can **only have** 1 type of perspecitve)
	- each objecet should be treated differentely
	- every object occupies it own space, the space may have it's own perspetice to the caemra
	- look at each object and its relation to the caemra, whether its facing the camera, below, above or rotated at what axis
		- if it directly facing you it is 1 point if 
		- it is only rotated in horizontal axis it is 2 point
		- it is rotated more than horizontal axis it is 3
