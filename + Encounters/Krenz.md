**basic perspective**
-  **how are the basic 1, 2 and 3 point perspective formed?**
	- 1 point - look directly at the object at eye level
	- vertical and horizontal axis has no convergence
	- 2 points -> rotating the block in 1 axis
	- now x and y converge
	- 3 point - rotating the previous cube again on another axis
		- looking up or down creates 3 point perespective


- what is the perspective in a scene?
	- ![[Pasted image 20251216142719.png]]
	- entire scene cannot be categorized as signle pserpsective system (NEVER think that 1 scene can **only have** 1 type of perspecitve)
	- each objecet should be treated differentely
	- every object occupies it own space, the space may have it's own perspective to the caemra
	- look at each object and its relation to the caemra, whether its facing the camera, below, above or rotated at what axis
		- if it directly facing you it is 1 point if 
		- it is only rotated in horizontal axis it is 2 point
		- it is rotated more than horizontal axis it is 3
**line work**
- do not hatch each line multiple lines
	- create larges margin of error and in the end your perspective will be complete off
	- these small errors will lead to large errors,
	- each perspective calculation is based on the accuracy of the previous, the errors build on top of each other quickly
- use wrist to draw short lines
- user shoulders to draw long lines

**drawing a building from ref**
1. identify the perspective of the building
	- draw lines through the object in ref
	- here the ref is close to 2 point
	- although it is not at eye level, it is still within our eye's vision and we don't need to tilt our head down to see it

2. map out the plane you are dealing with

3. draw the top and side views
	- figure out the big rations
	- aka the roof is 1/3 the height of side walls
	- ![[Pasted image 20251216143329.png]]
4. draw the ground plane, the extrude upwards on either sides and connect
	1. ![[Pasted image 20251216143415.png]]
5. map out the general ratios from the top and side view
