**Why am I introverted?**
Growing up in each main period of my life I only had one close friend.
When I was really young I think that was my sister, 
When I started going to Elementary, I had this one friend in elementary school from K - 2 grade but then she moved to Massachusetts
Then from 3 - 5 grade I was pretty close with Abby 
Then from 6 - 8 grade I was close with Sharon
Then from 9 - 12 grade I was basically alone, and had no close friends
Then in college I made friends with my roommates, I was pretty close with Sandy and Chris
Naturally I have always been very sensitive and probably have the [[SERT Gene]], I remember crying a lot as a child because I get overwhelmed easily by arguments, raised voices and expressions of disappointment or anger. 
Mom and Dad thought that solving the problem was just by yelling at me even more, which I don't think solved the problem and just made me close off to them more. 
Small things make me cry, sometimes even playing with my friends I would end up crying.
I remember this one time, in middle school my friends took my glasses and started running around with it and I cried because I couldn't see.
In elementary school, this girl kept hitting me with her long hair and I ended up crying.
In 4th grade when I had to present my project in front on the class I cried during the presentation because the person sitting right in front of me said that they couldn't hear me. 
I think that caused to learn to hide my feelings from them and basically taught me to not express my self. 
Which explains why I am not a very expressive person and very closed off from other people.

Socially I am also very sensitive, a lot of people seem to stress me out, I remember in college freshmen, year the beginning of the semester i would literally get nosebleeds everynight because of all the people I was meeting. My face was always red and my heart was always beating so fast. 



Why don't I feel lonely?
I have felt lonely when I am alone, I think I have felt more lonely around other people that I have when I am alone. 
The most lonely period of my life was high school, 
I never get bored, I because I have some many questions, I have so many books I want to read and things I want to build and learn, I actually get confused when people say they are bored. 
The immense computational power and energy required to develop semi-intelligent systems like ChatGPT are staggering. Yet, our brains naturally possess incredible cognitive capabilities, which we often take for granted. Instead of harnessing this potential, many people spend their time mindlessly scrolling through TikTok or watching TV, allowing their brains to atrophy rather than using them to their fullest extent.


**Questions**

My solution to find the almost perfect partner. 
One problem I had was I know that I am not ready now but how will I know when I will be ready. I think I will be ready when I have fully figured out my self and who I want to be, what my values are and what i like and what I dislike and stuff like. 
I will basically create a document about me, and once that is done, I think i would be ready, that means I have thought and written down about all of those things and know a lot about my self..

It doesn't make sense how most people just choose a partner because someone like them or because their heart beats faster when they are with them.
Of course that is the case we are animals and in our brains we are programmed to reproduce. So if someone likes you, your brain doesn't think about if they are a good person or if they are compatible with you, it tricks you into thinking that are so that it can reproduce. 

There is not finding the right person, you just have to become the right person and right person will show up at some point/


Why i quit social media
I don't feel FOMO because I know that I wouldn't want to be there and in that situation, if you show me some one having fun at party i don't feel FOMO because i know i wouldn't have fun at the party
All social media does is to tell you what to like, what to think, how to feel, but I don't want some algorithm to tell me these things, I want to naturally figure out my self, I want to know naturally what I will become interested in.

I have not been feeling good the past few days, I think it is definitely my eating habits, I think that is the issue that is affecting my focus, I will try tommorrow to eat protein in the morning immediately when I wake up and then have my eggs for breakfast, I think that I can’t focus because of my bad eating habits, I don’t actually eat therefore I feel hungry, but when I “eat” I still feel hungry and I think my brain I just confused,
Tommorrow my plan is wake up drink protein, eat eggs and then go exercise no execses, this should be for about an hour and start the book cue project until daily stand up, wake up at 6 - 15 breakfast, exercise until like 7-30 and then from 7-30 to like 930 am work on you app,  (this is the morning I want everyday )
Then gm stuff and then Cigna stuff and workout again (watch a tutorial or tsomething ) after lunch and then work on learning new things

It’s actually annoying how bad my focus is a I really need to fix it, it’s actually become a problem that is affecting my mental state

Everything meaningless, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth it

**Money**
I want to spend as little time thinking about money as possible

I want to build apps not because I want to make a lot of money it is because I like it and because what is the alternative. I am really lucky that I was so able to so quickly find something that I am pretty good at and enjoy doing more that most people so why not spend more time doing it. What is the alternative any way. spending all my time sitting around watching TV? I know that won't make me happy.
The goal is just to continue to build apps that I think are cool and other people will use. I am human and there probably thousands of people that are just like me. 
Salaries and money are byproducts of ambition not because they were your primary desire.
If your primary desire is to make as much money as possible



it is not that i don't care it is because i don't want to fight, i know how to are going to be like and i am the one who is going to end up getting the most hurt anyways so i just give up and let you win.
like i am so scared to making you upset i will do anything to prevent that from happening 

**Values**
Ambitious- I want to be a more capable person who is fully independent and does not nee the help of others. 

The feeling of being able to achieve something you never knew was possible is enpowering and makes you feel like you can achieve anything.

This is one of the main reasons I love rock climbing everyday I get to go there and try something that I then get better everyday.
Within rock climbing where are so many ways to improve whereas if you are weight lifting like the only time I would get a dopamine hit is when I lift a heavier weight, but that does not happen every day. 


Why am i so avoidant
avoidant people are fear of being abandoned, i feel like that like everyone's fear but we cope with it differently 
anxious people who fear abaondoned will overthink and be nervous and stress about it
avoidants will push people away or keep them at a distance so that they can abandon the other person before they can abandon the, 
i think subconsiouly it comes from my childhood, basically immediately when i was born i was abandoned by my parents, i felt like those years are extremely important in forming a secure relationship, I mean still i don't feel that close to my parents or anyone.
i think that alone already fucked up my brain chemsitry 
i expressed my wants and needs and was immediately shut down, i realized that i have to figure out everything myself because they aren't going to help me anyway
my sister and mom were really dismissive,
for example every winter my room gets like really fucking cold like, i would wake up in the middle of the night shivering, i would tell my dad and my sister all the time, but i was just ignored, 
maybe thats why i feel not pain, i just blocked it out so its easier for me to cope. 
its easier to suffer if you don't feel any pain, 
\
focsed on them selves
parents did n't attue to their emotions and struggle to vulnderablee, 
primitive instinct to focus on my s elf and where i need to go in life
fear

adult not attuned to emotions
i did not see adults clearly communicate abd work through issues and respect each other's differences of opinions
mom and dad definityly did not clearly communicate with each other and learn to respect each other's difference in opinions

even currently their differences of opinion with money is not healhyt
even the way mom makes me talk to him instead of talking to him herself 
grew up in a home where nothing is ever talked about and everything is ignored or swept under the rug
when i became an adult i learned how to not express my emotions 
and when i did i was just dismiessed and told to stop being dramatic or even punished


for example every time i cried or displayed emotion i was punished, i was yelled at for crying  

this is why i learned to avoid my emotions and choose to suppress them 
running away from the way to feel actually makes the relationship more difficult.

emotional abondonment
inconsisteny in feeling validated and loved. 
my dad never showed up for me at all .
growing up i never remeber seeing him there at my birthday, or when i had a piano performance for when i won an award at school my dad was never there only my mom, but also he never comes home for dinner, i think i can count on my fingers the number of times my dad has sat the dinner table with us as a family.

inconsisitency in parenting, somedays it seems like they love you can care for you and other days they criticize you
parents who crticize theri cuildren, creates children who will no longer share with them their hopes and dreams because they are just going to knock you down, 
they only like me down 

hitting your kids, falls under **inconsistent** parenting, as a child you may not undertand how could someone that is suppoed to love you want to hurt you.
I think that is very confusing for a kid to understand 

your also inconssitent sometimes, like sometimes you seem like you really like me but other times, 

emotionally immature parents view children as a source of their self esteem

my parents

**Do you even like hanging out with me or just find me annoying most of the time?**

I felt liked I did something to annoy you during mikado,

I felt that you were so mean to me, maybe it cuz I was on my period, and if I was just overthinking and got the wrong impression but it felt you hate me sometimes.

Was it because I was late?

Or when I asked about the happy hour thing? I was just genuinely curious if we could and if not no big deal, 

And then you whispered to Sandy about something 

Did I do something to annoy you during mikado, tuesday

I get the same feeling with my sister, like I feel like being myself is annoying to you so to cope i
