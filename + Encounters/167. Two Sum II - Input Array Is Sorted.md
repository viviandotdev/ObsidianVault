[[Two Sum]]


**Two Sum II - Input Array is sorted**

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **_sorted in non-decreasing order_**

find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number.
- the numbers exist in the array
- the array is sorted
- the array is 1-indexed instead of 0 indexed
The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.
- unique solution

**Summary**
Find 2 numbers in a **sorted array** that add up to a target value
- array is sorted
- the condition add up to a target value

**Input:** numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
2 pointers 
left pointer = beginning of the array
right pointer = end of the array
3 Possibilities
sum of elements are greater than target
	- answer too large make it smaller decrement right pointer 
sum of elements are less than target
	- answer is too small, increment left pointer
sum of elements is equal to target
	- we found our solution return (l + 1 and r + 1)
