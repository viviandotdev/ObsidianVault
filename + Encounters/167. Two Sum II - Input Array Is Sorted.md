**Two Sum II - Input Array is sorted**
Find 2 numbers in a **sorted array** that add up to a target value
- array is sorted
- the condition add up to a target value


Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **_sorted in non-decreasing order_**

find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number.
-
The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.
- unique solution

**Time Complexity**
$$
O(n^{2}) = > O(kn)
$$
