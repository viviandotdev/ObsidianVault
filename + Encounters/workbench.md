Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**observations**
- array of numbers
- move all the 0s to the end of the array
- maintain the relative order of the non zero elements
traverse the array backwards
start and end pointer
if we find a 0 at the start swap?
wrong? beceause 12 will end up at the start
pointer in the same director


Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
