## why do you draw?

The study of how to see the world

Everything that exists was produced from a sketch by someone

Drawing can you desires and be more creative and solve problems
Learn to draw everyday objects then carry your sketchbook with you everywhere to practice 
Live more intensely you can build your visual libaary and remember the beautiful things you see better
