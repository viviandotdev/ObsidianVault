**Brain dump**
- most people think they need a special idea to be successful
- however the success does not come from the idea
- ideas are abundant and they can be found any where
- what matters most is the execution
- you can copy someone else's ideas but skew a few value attributes such as better user interface or better functionality and execute on it well you will find success.

**Organized Idea**
