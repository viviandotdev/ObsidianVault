## Ideas are nothing what truly matters is execution

**Brain dump**
- most people think they need a special idea to be successful
- however the success does not come from the idea
- ideas are abundant and they can be found any where
- what matters most is the execution
- you can copy someone else's ideas but skew a few value attributes such as better user interface or better functionality and execute on it well you will find success.

**Organized Idea**
Success comes from execution not ideas. Most people believe that they need to revolutionary idea to build some thing successful. However what actually matters is the execution, without execution your ideas are nothing. Moreover ideas are abundant however execution is rare. Not many people have the ability to execute and execute well. Most ideas are executed poorly. You can often adapt existing ideas by tweaking a few attributes such as better UI or functionality and you have a new business idea.
