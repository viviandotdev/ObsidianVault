## Views on AI

- I


- AI has the power to change world in ways that people don't expect
- The real power in AI is the ability to speed up processes that would take humans are really long time
- Also AI has the ability to run simulations and go through iterations on things that would take forever.
- For example in biology AI could simulate thousands of trials of a specific drug to test its effectiveness, this is a process that could take humans years but AI can do it in seconds
- I think AI will help increase the speed of innovation
