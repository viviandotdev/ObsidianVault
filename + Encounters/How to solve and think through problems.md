## How to problem solve with observations

**Read and understand the problem statement**
- Read the problem and try to understand it
	- Chunk the problem into bits 
- Go through the examples the understand them
- Summarize the problem in your own words
**Identity key words and phrases**
- Go through the chunked problem, break it down, explain your though process for each chunk
	- Make concrete definitions
	- Identity any patterns that may help you solve this problem
	- What is possible?
	- What is not possible
	- ~~Tunnel vision~~ (Revisit your observations as needed)
**Identity directions of processing**
- Does the problem force you to go in a certain direction
- If any direction is good, which one is simplest or optimal
### Main Point
**Problem Solving**
- Problem solving is not just pattern matching, you have to be able to identitfy the patterns in the first place
- **Observation** is the root of problem solving, new problems require to carefully study the properties
- Complex problems will have many properties with too many obserivations, write them down so you don't forge them
**In any field** problem solving begins with observations, for example doctors problem solve my asking questions and observing their patient, lawyers problem solve also by asking questions and until they get to their solutions. Everything requires problem solving.
