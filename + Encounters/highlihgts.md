## THE FIRST NIGHT: DENY TRAUMA

### PEOPLE FABRICATE ANGER

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 477**
> It is not an extreme argument. If we proceed with your reasoning, any offence committed in anger can be blamed on anger, and will no longer be the responsibility of the person because, essentially, you are saying that people cannot control their emotions. YOUTH: Well, how do you explain my anger then? PHILOSOPHER: That's easy. You did not fly into a rage and then start shouting. It is solely that you got angry so that you could shout. In other words, in order to fulfil the goal of shouting, you created the emotion of anger.

**Note - Location 486**
> I do something wrong, her goal is to make me submit to her and listen what she has to say, in order to make me listen to her she shouts at me, when she is shouting at me the anger is created
>
> People think anger comes first and that leads them to shout
>
> But the philosopher argues rather the goal to make the other person submit to you comes first then you create the emotion of anger to fulfill that goal through shouting.
>
> This means that by shouting you create anger. Therefore if you just remove the goal of shouting you can actually prevent the anger emotion from being created.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 487**
> The goal of shouting came before anything else. That is to say, by shouting, you wanted to make the waiter submit to you and listen to what you had to say. As a means to do that, you fabricated the emotion of anger.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 507**
> That's right, anger is an instantaneous emotion. Now listen, I have a story. One day, a mother and daughter were quarrelling loudly. Then, suddenly, the telephone rang. 'Hello?' The mother picked up the receiver hurriedly, her voice still thick with anger. The caller was her daughter's homeroom teacher. As soon as the mother realised who was phoning, the tone of her voice changed and she became very polite. Then, for the next five minutes or so, she carried on a conversation in her best telephone voice. Once she hung up, in a moment, her expression changed again and she went straight back to yelling at her daughter.

**Note - Location 516**
> Evidence that anger is just a tool to achieve a selfish egotistical goal to make someone else feel small. A mother can be on the phone and kindly request something from someone and then instantly yell at her daughter right after, The mother is controlling her anger and using it in the correct context

### HOW TO LIVE WITHOUT BEING CONTROLLED BY THE PAST

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 559**
> Life isn't just hard. If the past determined everything and couldn't be changed, we who are living today would no longer be able to take effective steps forward in our lives. What would happen as a result?

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 574**
> Freudian aetiology that denies our free will, and treats humans like machines.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 576**
> 'People are not driven by past causes, but move toward goals that they themselves set'—

### ARE YOU OKAY JUST AS YOU ARE?

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 643**
> As I said earlier, it's just that I admire him and I think I'd be happier if I were like him. PHILOSOPHER: You think you'd be happier if you were like him. Which means that you are not happy now, right? YOUTH: What!

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 659**
> At the very least, I do not think I would like to be a different person and I accept who I am.

**Note - Location 660**
> People who are happy accept who they are and would not like to be anybody else
>
> I feel my my mom wants to change to be a different person, 这就是我的性格。我人就是这样。我过几年可以变。但是又不知道。我只能知道这是我现在喜欢和不喜欢的东西。如果你不喜欢我你在去声你喜欢的孩子。I accept who I am -> 我接受我的自己

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 661**
> PHILOSOPHER: Look, no matter how much you want to be Y, you cannot be reborn as him. You are not Y. It's okay for you to be you.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 670**
> 'The important thing is not what one is born with, but what use one makes of that equipment.' You want to be Y or someone else because you are utterly focused on what you were born with. Instead, you've got to focus on what you can make of your equipment.

**Note - Location 674**
> Even if you are born as you are this does not mean that you can't change. There are parts of you that you are born with and you should accept that that is what you started with, your job is to make the best of what you have. There is no point in dwelling about things you cannot change.

### UNHAPPINESS IS SOMETHING YOU CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 675**
> UNHAPPINESS IS SOMETHING YOU CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF

---

### PEOPLE ALWAYS CHOOSE NOT TO CHANGE

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 738**
> In Adlerian psychology, we describe personality and disposition with the word 'lifestyle'. YOUTH: Lifestyle? PHILOSOPHER: Yes. Lifestyle is the tendencies of thought and action in life.

**Note - Location 741**
> You lifestyle is your personality. Lifestyle is more flexible whereas personality can sound fixed. People often think they are born with their personality and that can't be changed and they use that as an excuse for why they can't change. However in Adlerian psychology your lifestyle is your personality. Lifestyle is always changing. Your lifestyles when you were a kid is different from an adult. You have control over your lifestyle. To live a happy life you need to design a full filling lifestyle that you can sustain over a long period of time and that makes you happy.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 830**
> When we try to change our lifestyles, we put our great courage to the test. There is the anxiety generated by changing, and the disappointment attendant to not changing. I am sure you have selected the latter.

**Note - Location 834**
> It requires a lot of courage to change your lifestyles. Changing your lifestyle will bring a lot of stress and anxiety. Even if we don't like our current situation we choose not to change because it feels familiar.

### YOUR LIFE IS DECIDED HERE AND NOW

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 874**
> It's actually that he wants to leave the possibility of 'I can do it if I try' open, by not committing to anything. He doesn't want to expose his work to criticism, and he certainly doesn't want to face the reality that he might produce an inferior piece of writing and face rejection.

**Note - Location 879**
> By not committing to something you can fall back on the illusion that if I tried I can do it. This is a mindset I have fallen for often. I have never really gave anything my best shot because of the fear of failure and criticism. I think I know where my fear of criticism comes from and I need to let it go. I'm going to try and give it my best shot and do it for me because I think it's cool and that's enough for me.
>
> **The Novelist's Excuse**
> - A young friend dreams of being a novelist but blames his job for his lack of progress.
> - The real reason is fear of criticism and rejection, preferring the possibility of success over the reality of potential failure.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 911**
> Rather, as Adler's teleology tells us, 'No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on.' That you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines your own life.

**Note - Location 915**
> Present choices dictate your future. Do not let your past hold you back. Life in present always moving forward and doing the best with what you have now.

## THE SECOND NIGHT: ALL PROBLEMS ARE INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS

### WHY YOU DISLIKE YOURSELF

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1000**
> The fact that her unrequited love would negate everything for her; the very existence and possibility of 'I'. This aspect is deeply present in adolescent unrequited love. But as long as she has a fear of blushing, she can go on thinking, I can't be with him because I have this fear of blushing. It could end without her ever working up the courage to confess her feelings to him, and she could convince herself that he would reject her anyway. And finally, she can live in the possibility that If only my fear of blushing had gotten better, I could have

**Note - Location 1008**
> We fabricate these fears and reasons to prevent us from having the courage to what we actually want.
>
> We don't want to believe we could so we make these fears so we have a reason not to.
>
> I grew up with this blushing problem. Every time I spoke to someone or when someone looked at me I would turn bright red. I think I am just easily overwhelmed and sensitive.

---

### ALL PROBLEMS ARE INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1101**
> being alone isn't what makes you feel lonely. Loneliness is having other people and society and community around you, and having a deep sense of being excluded from them. To feel lonely, we need other people. That is to say, it is only in social contexts that a person becomes an 'individual'.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1122**
> all problems are interpersonal relationship problems. This is a concept that runs to the very root of Adlerian psychology. If all interpersonal relationships were gone from this world, which is to say **if one were alone in the universe and all other people were gone, all manner of problems would disappear.**

---

### FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY ARE SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1216**
> My feelings about my height were all subjective feelings of inferiority, which arose entirely through my comparing myself to others. That is to say, in my interpersonal relationships. Because if there hadn't been anyone with whom to compare myself, I wouldn't have had any occasion to think I was short. Right now, you too are suffering from various feelings of inferiority. But please understand that what you are feeling is not an objective inferiority, but a subjective feeling of inferiority. Even with an issue like height, it's all reduced to its subjectivity. YOUTH: In other words, **the feelings of inferiority we're suffering from are subjective interpretations rather than objective facts?**

---

### BRAGGARTS HAVE FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1397**
> However, people who aren't equipped with that courage end up stepping into an inferiority complex. Again, it's thinking, I'm not well educated, so I can't succeed.

**Note - Location 1399**
> I think mom has an inferiority complex and projecting that on to me and her children. Because she has never had an education that means she cannot learn anything. She has never really tried to learn anything nor does she want to. I think she projects that on to me by always saying I can't do this I can't do that. We need to ask them to do this. This is because she literally can't do anything for herself.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1409**
> One is suffering from strong feelings of inferiority, and, on top of that, one doesn't have the courage to compensate through healthy modes of striving and growth.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1432**
> I don't know much about fashion, but I think it's advisable to think of people who wear rings with rubies and emeralds on all their fingers as having issues with feelings of inferiority, rather than issues of aesthetic sensibility. In other words, they have signs of a superiority complex.

**Note - Location 1437**
> People who don't have the courage to healthily improve their situation with their inferiority complex will try to compensate with their superiority complex by making it seem like they have everything and are important.
>
> Why would people do this? They don't want to put the work of...

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1491**
> They use their misfortune to their advantage, and try to control the other party with it. By declaring how unfortunate they are and how much they have suffered, they are trying to worry the people around them (their family and friends, for example), and to restrict their speech and behaviour, and control them.

**Note - Location 1496**
> People will exploit their weaknesses to make others feel like they need to worry about them. We often use our own weaknesses as an excuse.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1499**
> 'In our culture weakness can be quite strong and powerful.'

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1501**
> 'In fact, if we were to ask ourselves who is the strongest person in our culture, the logical answer would be the baby. The baby rules and cannot be dominated.' The baby rules over the adults with his weakness. And it is because of this weakness that no one can control him.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1508**
> You don't understand how I feel'—are likely to contain a certain degree of truth. Completely understanding the feelings of the person who is suffering is something that no one is capable of. But as long as one continues to use one's misfortune to one's advantage in order to be 'special', one will always need that misfortune.

---

### YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WORRYING ABOUT YOUR APPEARANCE

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1690**
> You think of interpersonal relationships as competition; you perceive other people's happiness as 'my defeat', and that is why you can't celebrate it. However, once one is released from the schema of competition, the need to triumph over someone disappears.

**Note - Location 1693**
> Your friends are not your competitors. I don't really see friends as my competitors. I like to watch them grow which motivates me to grow as well.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1711**
> Raised by strict parents, the youth had been oppressed and compared to his elder brother ever since childhood. None of his opinions were ever heard, and he was subjected to the violent words that he was a poor excuse for a little brother. Unable to make friends even at school, he spent all his break time alone in the library, which became his sole place of refuge. This youth who had passed his early years in such a way was truly an inhabitant of aetiology. If he had not been raised by those parents; if that elder brother had never existed; and if he had not attended that school, he could have had a brighter life. The youth had been trying to participate in the discussion as cool-headedly as possible, but now his many years of pent-up feelings came bursting out.

**Note - Location 1716**
> I feel similarly, although I did not grow up with strict parents, I did have thoughts what if my parents didn't send me to China.

---

### FROM POWER STRUGGLE TO REVENGE

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1770**
> In this case, what is the other person's goal? Is it only that he wants to discuss politics? No, it isn't. It's that he finds you unbearable, and he wants to criticise and provoke you, and make you submit through a power struggle. If you get angry at this point, the moment he has been anticipating will arrive, and the relationship will suddenly turn into a power struggle. No matter what the provocation, you must not get taken in.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1781**
> Now, let's say you take control of the quarrel. And then the other man, who was seeking to defeat you, withdraws in a sportsmanlike manner. The thing is, the power struggle doesn't end there. Having lost the dispute, he rushes onto the next stage. YOUTH: The next stage? PHILOSOPHER: Yes. It's the revenge stage. Though he has withdrawn for the time being, he will be scheming some revenge in another place and another form, and will reappear with an act of retaliation.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1789**
> The child oppressed by his parents will turn to delinquency. He'll stop going to school. He'll cut his wrists or engage in other acts of self-harm. In Freudian aetiology, this is regarded as simple cause and effect: the parents raised the child in this way, and that is why the child grew up to be like this.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1806**
> There are probably a lot of people who feel mystified by seeing a child who cuts his wrists, and think, Why would he do such a thing? But try to think how the people around the child—the parents, for instance—will feel as a result of the behaviour of wrist-cutting. If you do, the goal behind the behaviour should come into view of its own accord.

**Note - Location 1811**
> I remember having thoughts like this as a kid, because of the lack of care or attention I felt from my parents I would hit myself as an act of revenge to see how it makes them feel. As my parents I know it would hurt them if I tried to hurt myself but it was okay if they hurt me in their controlled way.

---

### ADMITTING FAULT IS NOT DEFEAT

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1853**
> The moment one is convinced that 'I am right' in an interpersonal relationship, one has already stepped into a power struggle.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 1860**
> In other words, the conviction that 'I am right' leads to the assumption that 'this person is wrong', and finally it becomes a contest and you are thinking, I have to win. It's a power struggle through and through.

**Note - Location 1864**
> **Most people have a power struggle, they have the desire to be right. The desire to be right means that the other person must be wrong.**

---

## THE THIRD NIGHT: DISCARD OTHER PEOPLE'S TASKS

### DENY THE DESIRE FOR RECOGNITION

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2303**
> Let's talk about one of the major premises of Adlerian psychology regarding this matter. Adlerian psychology denies the need to seek recognition from others. YOUTH: It denies the desire for recognition? PHILOSOPHER: There is no need to be recognised by others.

---

### DO NOT LIVE TO SATISFY THE EXPECTATIONS OF OTHERS

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2310**
> DO NOT LIVE TO SATISFY THE EXPECTATIONS OF OTHERS

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2335**
> In many cases, it is due to the influence of reward-and-punishment education. YOUTH:

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2340**
> If no one is going to praise me, I won't take appropriate action and If no one is going to punish me, I'll engage in inappropriate actions, too. You already have the goal of wanting to be praised when you start picking up litter. And if you aren't praised by anyone, you'll either be indignant, or decide that you'll never do such a thing again. Clearly, there's something wrong with this situation.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2351**
> You are not living to satisfy other people's expectations, and neither am I. It is not necessary to satisfy other people's expectations.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2356**
> if you are not living your life for yourself, then who is going to live it for you? You are living only your own life. When it comes to who you are living it for, of course it's you. And then, if you are not living your life for yourself, who could there be to live it instead of you? Ultimately, we live thinking about 'I'. There is no reason that we must not think that way.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2366**
> It is not nihilism at all. Rather, it's the opposite. When one seeks recognition from others, and concerns oneself only with how one is judged by others, in the end, one is living other people's lives.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2373**
> And please remember this: if you are not living to satisfy other people's expectations, it follows that other people are not living to satisfy your expectations. Someone might not act the way you want him to, but it doesn't do to get angry. That's only natural.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2416**
> It might come as a surprise to you, but almost none of my clients who come for counselling are selfish people. Rather, they are suffering trying to meet the expectations of other people, the expectations of their parents and teachers.

**Note - Location 2419**
> It is not selfish to live to other people's expectations. You should not expect other people to live up to expectation either.
>
> You are suffering when trying to live of the expectations of anyone but yourself.

### HOW TO SEPARATE TASKS

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2444**
> When one is confronted with the task of studying, for instance, in Adlerian psychology we consider it from the perspective of 'whose task is this?'

**Note - Location 2447**
> Do not intrude on other people's tasks and don't let other people intrude on your own.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2448**
> Whether the child studies or not. Whether he goes out and plays with his friends, or not. Essentially this is the child's task, not the parent's task.

**Note - Location 2450**
> Example: Studying is the child's tasks not the parent's task.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2462**
> In general, all interpersonal relationship troubles are caused by intruding on other people's tasks, or having one's own tasks intruded on.

**Note - Location 2464**
> My relationship troubles are caused by the separation of tasks. My mother is trying to intrude on my tasks of finding a partner. This is my task and the outcome will affect me the most.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2472**
> Who ultimately is going to receive the end result brought about by the choice that is made?

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2485**
> But they are clearly doing so in order to fulfil their own goals, which could be their appearance in the eyes of society, their need to put on airs, or their desire for control, for example. In other words, it is not 'for your own good', but for the parents'. And it is because the child senses this deception that he rebels.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2496**
> Instead, it is by knowing what the child is doing that one protects him. If it's studying that is the issue, one tells the child that that is his task, and one lets him know that one is ready to assist him whenever he has the urge to study. But one must not intrude on the child's task. When no requests are being made, it does not do to meddle in things.

**Note - Location 2502**
> Not intruding in other people's task does not mean you don't have to be interested in what the child is doing. Not intruding does not mean non-interference. As a parent do not meddle in your child's tasks but you should be ready to assist them when they have the urge to study. Instead of telling them you need to study now, you can let them know that you are ready to assist them when they want to study.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2518**
> You are the only one who can change yourself.

---

### DISCARD OTHER PEOPLE'S TASKS

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2544**
> A parent suffering over the relationship with his or her child will tend to think, My child is my life. In other words, the parent is taking on the child's task as his or her own, and is no longer able to think about anything but the child.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2557**
> Though the child is one's own, he or she is not living to satisfy one's expectations as a parent.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2581**
> And discard other people's tasks. That is the first step toward lightening the load and making life simpler.

---

### HOW TO RID YOURSELF OF INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2597**
> Now, wait a minute. Are you saying that it doesn't matter how sad I make my parents feel? PHILOSOPHER: That's right. It doesn't matter.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 2617**
> What other people think when they see your face—that is the task of other people, and is not something you have any control over.

**Note - Location 2619**
> The judgement of other people has nothing to do with you. What they think of you, whether they like you or dislike you is their task. All you can do is to live your own life and do what you think is right, it does not matter what other people think of those actions that is their own task for thinking that way.

### YOU HOLD THE CARDS TO INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3009**
> way. Because my father was a moody, taciturn person. But to think to myself, He hit me that time, and that is why our relationship went bad, is a Freudian aetiological way of thinking. The Adlerian teleology position completely reverses the cause-and-effect interpretation. That is to say, I brought out the memory of being hit because I don't want my relationship with my father to get better. YOUTH: So, first you had the goal of not wanting your relationship with your father to get better, and not wanting to repair things between you. PHILOSOPHER: That's right. For me, it was more convenient to not repair my relationship with my father.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3030**
> As long as I use aetiology to think, It is because he hit me that I have a bad relationship with my father, it would be a matter that was impossible for me to do anything about. But if I can think, I brought out the memory of being hit because I don't want my relationship with my father to get better, then I will be holding the card to repair relations. Because if I can just change the goal that fixes everything.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3052**
> Many people think that the interpersonal relationship cards are held by the other person. That is why they wonder, How does that person feel about me?, and end up living in such a way as to satisfy the wishes of other people. But if they can grasp the separation of tasks, they will notice that they are holding all the cards. This is a new way of thinking.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3058**
> So, due to your changing, did your father change too? PHILOSOPHER: I did not change in order to change my father. That is an erroneous notion of trying to manipulate another person. Even if I change, it is only 'I' who changes. I do not know what will happen to the other person as a result, and that is not an aspect I can take part in.

## THE FOURTH NIGHT: WHERE THE CENTRE OF THE WORLD IS

### THE GOAL OF INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS IS A FEELING OF COMMUNITY

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3252**
> When there are two people, society emerges in their presence, and community emerges there too. To gain an understanding of the community feeling that Adler speaks of, it is advisable to use 'you and I' as the starting point.

**Note - Location 3256**
> A community creates interpersonal relationships.
>
> One needs to think not, what will this person give me, but rather, what can I give to this person? That is commitment to the community.

---

### YOU ARE NOT THE CENTRE OF THE WORLD

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3396**
> One needs to think not What will this person give me? but, rather, What can I give to this person? That is commitment to the community.

---

### DO NOT REBUKE OR PRAISE

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3583**
> In Adlerian psychology, we take the stance that in childrearing, and in all other forms of communication with other people, one must not praise.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3606**
> The example of animal training that you just gave is also emblematic of the hierarchical relationship—the vertical relationship—that is behind the praising. When one person praises another, the goal is 'to manipulate someone who has less ability than you'. It is not done out of gratitude or respect.

**Note - Location 3611**
> When you praise someone it is to manipulate someone of less ability? How does it manipulate them? It makes them feel less than. It also makes them seek out the praise again leading them to the same action. Similar to how parents praise their children, their children will grow up forever chasing that praise. This creates an unhealthy hierarchal relationship between them.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3615**
> The reason that Adlerian psychology is highly critical of reward-and-punishment education is that its intention is to manipulate children.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3627**
> This is proof that one is seeing all interpersonal relationships as 'vertical relationships'. This holds true for you, too:

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3630**
> Adlerian psychology refutes all manner of vertical relationships, and proposes that all interpersonal relationships be horizontal relationships. In a sense, this point may be regarded as the fundamental principle of Adlerian psychology.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3643**
> A company employee and a full-time housewife simply have different workplaces and roles, and are truly 'equal but not the same'.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3653**
> In the first place, the feeling of inferiority is an awareness that arises within vertical relationships. If one can build horizontal relationships that are 'equal but not the same' for all people, there will no longer be any room for inferiority complexes to emerge.

### THE ENCOURAGEMENT APPROACH

> university.' Whereas, assistance, on the other hand, presupposes the separation of tasks, and also horizontal relationships.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3698**
> Concretely speaking, instead of commanding from above that the child must study, one acts on him in such a way that he can gain the confidence to take care of his own studies and face his tasks on his own.

---

### HOW TO FEEL YOU HAVE VALUE

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3747**
> One cannot praise, and one cannot rebuke. What other words and choices are there? PHILOSOPHER: Think about a time when you've had help in your work—not from a child, but from a partner who is your equal—and you will probably see the answer right away. When a friend helps you clean your home, what do you say to him? YOUTH: I say, 'Thank you.' PHILOSOPHER: Right. You convey words of gratitude, saying thank you to this partner who has helped you with your work. You might express straightforward delight: 'I'm glad.' Or you could convey your thanks by saying, 'That was a big help.' This is an approach to encouragement that is based on horizontal relationships.

**Note - Location 3758**
> If you cannot praise what should you say instead? You can use words of gratitude to show respect and joy.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3759**
> Judgement is a word that comes out of vertical relationships. If one is building horizontal relationships, there will be words of more straightforward gratitude and respect and joy.

**Note - Location 3762**
> Judgement comes out of vertical relationships.

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3794**
> It is when one is able to feel I am beneficial to the community that one can have a true sense of one's worth.

### EXIST IN THE PRESENT

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 3868**
> Your mother might not be able to do anything in her critical condition that would be considered an act, but just by being alive, she would be supporting the psychological state of you and your family, and would therefore be of use. The same could be said for you, too.

---

## THE FIFTH NIGHT: TO LIVE IN EARNEST IN THE HERE AND NOW

### NOT SELF-AFFIRMATION—SELF-ACCEPTANCE

**Highlight (yellow) - Location 4165**
> With self-acceptance, on the other hand, if one cannot do something, one is simply accepting 'one's incapable self' as is, and moving forward so that one can do whatever one can. It is not a way of lying to oneself. To put it more simply, say you've got a score of sixty per cent, but you tell yourself I just happened to get unlucky this time around, and the real me is one hundred per cent. That is self-affirmation. By contrast, if one accepts oneself as one is, as sixty per cent, and thinks to oneself, How should I go about getting closer to one hundred per cent?—that is self-acceptance.

**Note - Location 4173**
> Self-acceptance vs self-affirmation: Self-affirmation is lying to yourself and believing you are better than you currently are. Self acceptance is being honest with yourself and thinking about how you can become better.

### THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUST AND CONFIDENCE

> But if you are afraid to have confidence in others, in the long run, you will not be able to build deep relationships with anyone.

**Note - Location 4323**
> Building deep and strong interpersonal relationships require unconditional confidence. Unconditional confidence does not mean believing people even if they deceive. Having unconditional confidence in the person makes the relationship better. You should trust and have confidence in your friends if you want that relationship to be better. If you do not have the desire to make the relationships with that person better you can sever the relationship but that is your task.

> I have deep confidence that the people around me are good people.

> Exactly. In effect, placing confidence in others is connected to seeing others as comrades. It is because they are one's comrades that one can have confidence in them.

### YOUNG PEOPLE WALK AHEAD OF ADULTS

> To make matters worse, the family takes that for granted, and they don't make the slightest effort to help. In such a situation, normally one would think, Why won't they give me a hand? or Why do I have to do all the work? Even if I do not hear the words 'thank you' from my family while I am cleaning up, I want them to think that I am of use to the family. Instead of thinking about what others can do for me, I want to think about, and put into practice, what I can do for other people. Just by having that feeling of contribution, the reality right in front of me will take on a completely different hue.

> I have discussed self-acceptance, confidence in others and contribution to others, in that order. However, these three are linked as an indispensable whole, in a sort of circular structure. It is because one accepts oneself just as one is—one self-accepts—that one can have 'confidence in others' without the fear of being taken advantage of. And it is because one can place unconditional confidence in others, and feel that people are one's comrades, that one can engage in 'contribution to others'. Further, it is because one contributes to others that one can have the deep awareness that 'I am of use to someone,' and accept oneself just as one is. One can self-accept.

> Self-acceptance enables confidence, which enables contribution, which reinforces self-acceptance.
