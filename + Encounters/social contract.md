## social contract

implicit **agreement among members of society to cooperate for social benefits.**
individuals are willing to give up some rights in exchange for the benefits of society such as safety, employment and social welfare

for example giving up our rights to bear arms for the safety of society would be an example of the social contract

the social contract falls apart when we give up these rights but don't see the benefits of society.
