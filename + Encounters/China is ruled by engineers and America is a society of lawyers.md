The **Lawyerly** Society vs the **Engineering** State

China builds while America debates
Lawyers block anything, good and bad therefore we don't have any functional infrastructure anywhere

 The problem is that they are also social engineers that treat society as a giant math exercise — when the Chinese government decides that the population is just another problem to be optimized. Creating stupid ideas like the [[one-child policy]]




China 
- economic bully
- thief of American intellectual property
- hardcore surveillance state
- propaganda state

**Common**
- they are both striving toward something which is something that is not apparent in other countries.
