create problem and instability
For our purposes, a Problem needs three components:
1. AN INSTABILITY:
2. THE CONSEQUENCES of that instability, presented
	- most often as the “Costs” of leaving the instability unstable;
	- sometimes as the “Benefits” of stabilizing it. 
3. READERS who constitute a community of discourse defined by their interest in a topic and who will accept or are open to accepting the cost/benefits.

INSTABILITY create costs from self interested readeres
INSTABILITY if made stable will beneift the readers
