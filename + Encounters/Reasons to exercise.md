How does exercise promote BNDF


Why I exercise

Improves cognitive function,
When you exercise neurons in our brain fire more to control movement, coordination and balance,
Due to this higher activity neurons which are brain cells get the signal to produce more of the BDNF protein,
Cells can produce proteins by converting DNA to mRNA to proteins, cells have dna which contain the instructions to create the protein, a specific signal is sent to the neurons which turns on the genes to create the BDNF protein.

What sends the signals?
Your muscles can release signaling molecules called myokines to tell the neurons more BDNF


•	DNA = cookbook
	•	Gene = recipe
	•	Turning on a gene = choosing to cook that recipe
	•	Protein = the finished dish



We have a brain to control movements, studies have shown that koala adapted to have smaller brains when their lifestyle became more sedentary.




**how does exercise help cognitive performance?**
[[BDNF]]
what is the process and what does the body go through when we exercise?


what is zone 2 exercise?


what are the best protocols for improving exercise


time under tension, protocol
instead of having all that time wasted preparing for the set, you can condense the tension period to a shorter amount of time, optimizing for muscle growth

titles: exercise does not cause weight loss

My mother always told me to you need to exercise to lose weight. However this is not the case because exercise does not cause weight loss. Exercise is for muscle gain.

problem -> instability

- What are the common goals related to this topic? What problems arise, and what typical advice is offered to solve them?
	- most people think that exercise creates weight loss
