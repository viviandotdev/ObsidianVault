**Book Spark**

For most of my life, exercise has been **marketed as a weight loss strategy**. At the start of every year there is the spike in gym memberships of people who want to lose weight.  We have all heard the phrase **calories in, calories out**. If you spend time at the gym burning more calories that you eat you will lose weight.

However this is not how the body works, studies have shown that **exercise does not cause weight loss**.

In fact energy expenditure actually plateaus, meaning the at after a certain amount of exercise, you don't keep burning calories at the same rate.
Our body sets a limit to how much energy it is willing to expend

However this does not mean that exercise does not contribute to weight loss, in addition exercise has many other benefits that are arguably a lot better than weight loss

- **Improves congitive function**
	- When you exercise neurons in our brain fire more to control movement, coordination and balance, Due to this higher activity neurons which are brain cells get the signal to produce more of the BDNF protein, Cells can produce proteins by converting DNA to mRNA to proteins, cells have dna which contain the instructions to create the protein, a specific signal is sent to the neurons which turns on the genes to create the BDNF protein.
- Increase allieviates stress, depression and anxieity
	- Releases norephinrerinece, serotiinen and dopamine
- Reduce inflammation, and Longevirity
	- Muscles can decrease insulin resistance, this allows more glucose to enter your cells keeping blood sugar low. We only need a little bit of insulin for 
	- during exercise when the muslces contract it release signaling molecules called myokines 


Why I exercise

Improves cognitive function,

What sends the signals?
Your muscles can release signaling molecules called myokines to tell the neurons more BDNF


•	DNA = cookbook
	•	Gene = recipe
	•	Turning on a gene = choosing to cook that recipe
	•	Protein = the finished dish



We have a brain to control movements, studies have shown that koala adapted to have smaller brains when their lifestyle became more sedentary.




**how does exercise help cognitive performance?**
[[BDNF]]
what is the process and what does the body go through when we exercise?


what is zone 2 exercise?


what are the best protocols for improving exercise


time under tension, protocol
instead of having all that time wasted preparing for the set, you can condense the tension period to a shorter amount of time, optimizing for muscle growth

titles: exercise does not cause weight loss

My mother always told me to you need to exercise to lose weight. However this is not the case because exercise does not cause weight loss. Exercise is for muscle gain.

problem -> instability

	- most people think that exercise creates weight loss
