#action Create a directional document, of a few things and goals can focus on,
You need to pick something on the horizon and go towards it or else you will just walk in circles
There is this study were they put people in a forest with any direction and told then to walk in a straight line and they literally ended up walking in circles. 
It is not the goal, just pick a direction of where you want to go, or else you will go in circles for years and move towards to figuring things out


[The many world of enough](https://moretothat.com/the-many-worlds-of-enough/)

"Ambition is largely driven by self-actualization, or the desire to become [a more capable person](https://moretothat.com/the-staircase-of-the-self/). And when this happens, it’s only natural that good outcomes arise. You’ll witness bumps in your reputation, be offered higher salaries, and so on. But these things happen as a _byproduct_ of your ambition, and not because these outcomes were your primary desires."

Salaries and money are byproducts of ambition not because they were your primary desire.
If your primary desire is to make as much money as possible that is greed.
On the spiral dynamics chart at stage orange people value efficiency and maximizing profits no matter what this is what capitalism is based off of.

I don't need anymore money I don't need any more things. I already get to wake up everyday, spend my time how I want to if you choose to chase money and things there will never be enough. There will always be more money and things to have, 
Money is infinite we can print more of it and and create it from nothing its just paper.
Don't you think it is weird to say you don't believe in God but you believe in money. We have to believe in money because if we didn't society would collapse.

Overtime ambition can become greed if you don't have the self awareness to correct it.

The best way to get things done or learn something new is to through short periods of intensity and then dialing it down to learn new things, choose one thing and learn it intently for 7 weeks and then learn another thing
Similiar to Paul Grahm's suggestion of learning many new things but exponenitally less time on each, for example 8 hours coding 4 hours rock climbing 2 hours piano, and more 1 hour reading 
choose a skill and learn it well for 7 weeks
**blender modeling 7-weeks**
chess 7 -weeks
drawing 7-wweek
piano


Human beings are so weird, there is nothing that I can say to him to make want stop wasting his time and playing games. The more I tell him to stop that more he will 

the world is designed to force you to specialize, schools want you to pick a major as soon as possible and stick with it for the rest of your life. However life is long and you most likely will not be doing that one thing for the rest of your life 


we only get such a short time so i want to use it 



**Opportunity is everywhere, there are millions of ways to make money but they require time and skills, if you develop your skills overtime you will gain wealth, if you focus on the right things you will become healthy, I think we are much closer to the smartest people in the world than we think, if we focused on the same things they did and learned from the same people could we be just like them?**

Spiral dynamics

Same thing how religions or god is not reality it just our way of thinking about reality

Everything is relative so there is no truth.

People think they are different but the structure of their mind is the same.

Those people on TV arguing about Capitalism and Communism, however if their experience were the same they would believe the opposite all they see is right and wrong


How are you supposed to develop if you don't know what you will develop into? 

Learning and understand the different stages will allow to go through the faster, by being aware of what is the next stage it gives you something to work towards



**Things you cannot buy and that must be earned**
whats the point of having and making some much money if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it?
**Calm mind**
**Fit body**
(get a calm mind and a fit body and you relationships will follow)
And a house full of love

A lovely house hold is just a byproduct of those things, you are healthy and a calm build you will be able to build good relationships

3 Hobbies
Makes you money (software development)
Keeps you fit (working out)
Makes you creative or makes you smarter (reading)



I think an important criteria for me is to that my parents like them,
I learn from examples, I don't think I have ever seen an example in real life of a relationship that I would like to emulate or like look up to.
But like a year or two I remember watching a show that really showed a relationship that i would like to emulate
all i want is to have someone believe in me at the times when i don't believe in myself 

- Someone who tells me I'm wrong without making me feel stupid. 
- Someone that would listen to what I have to say without making me feel like my feelings are invalid.
- Someone who supports me and my dreams
- Someone who does not make me feel exhausted when I am with them.
- Someone who is straightforward and can communicate clearly and effectively


to get your day right you will get your life right, life is built on top a set of system or routines that you follow everydat

**You are happiest when working towards your goals, not when you have achieved them**

This means that you are much closer to being the happiest version of yourself than you think

  

You can tell how much you love yourself based on the partner you choose

  

I think love is platonic and does not have to have to be romantic, I think its important to prioritize love for my friendships and family, I that romantic love usually ends and are experiences that you can look back on fondly , why would I want to keep putting effort into memories that you eventually want to forget when instead I can just put more energy into my family and friends and can always look back on them?

  

Being a relationship and getting married is more like a side quest, the main question is **finding ways to make my self happy** and if along the way I find someone that can **help me make myself happier** great if not I’m still happy regardless. 


I want to be able to make myself happy.

Not find someone else to make me happy.

In life happiness is my end goal. If being in a relationship with a man helps make that more achievable great if not than I’m still happy regardless
  

Philosophy means the love of wisdom, philosophy was created from anxious who love to theorize and ruminate about themselves and why they are the way they are, and like to think about why things are they way they are because **they are not content with what they know or believe about the world**


**Values**

- I think it is better to assume the better of people then to assume the worst of people.
- i don't believe in getting angry, i think anger shows a lack of control over your own emotions. Often getting angry hurts another individual emotionally or physically which is not some thing i want to do.


One of the best ways to test other people's temper is to test their patience over small things. If they get upset over the littlest things then that is gives you a clue into the way they will react over larger issues. 



 **Financial stability is mental stability**

  

**Building mental toughness is important**

**Do we love our children**

  

In the past few year inflation is growing much faster than wages

And the social contrat is decreasing, the percentage to 30 year olds earning more than their parents is falling

The youth are making less money doing the same work

  

Young people are angry we don’t get the same prosperity as their elders

Home prices are up and out of reach

  

Wealth is transferred to the elderly


Higher ed should be about taking unremarkable kids and giving them a chance
Artificially constrain supply 

College is a hedge fund offering classes
Affirmative action should be based on income not the color of your skin.
  

Capital is growing 
Wages vs wealth, wages have barely moved compared to the S&p500
The higher ed should give the opportunity for the unremarkable 

Social security, is the great transfer from young to old,
Old people vote are in charge, the old people in charge will not understand the challenges of the youth.
