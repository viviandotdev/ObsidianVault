What is going on in israel?

identity diversification
- do not tie your entire identity to your work
- you don't have to chase prestige, 
	- i am not interested in prestige or getting a higher. paying job or even getting a rise
	- work is not meant to be something that fulfills me 
	- it does not matter what job I have or for what company i work for, I don't think i will be ever be passionate building something for someone else. 
	- for example working at cigna, I am so aware. of what the company does I doesn't feel good or right to work really hard for a company that is literally killing people
