**In My Life**

- my appetite /stomach still feels a little weid, like i really don't want to eat as much, i feel constantly bloated
- started reading this week, i really do like to read it's like watching TV but its kinda better, i feel like no a days tv is really bad like the writing on tv shows these days are so shit bro, books seem to be a little better it's not as cringe, there is no giant corporation behind it is usually just individual authors. 
- this half the year i will try to read more instead of watching shows


**Ideas**
<!-- Capture the ideas or thoughts that spark excitement, and everything that pops into your head -->
**The courage to be disliked**
- really interesting idea about anger, people commonly think that anger is something that you can’t control it’s an emotions that pops out of no where and you need to express your self to let it out
- Anger is fabricated, it is created to fulfill a goal of yours
- For example when you get anger and shout at a waitress your goal is to make the waitress fail small, it is a tool we use to achieve a goal


AI has a significant negative impact on the economy, AI actually requires a lot of clean drinking water to cool down the systems therefore, a lot clean water is being used up in even areas where there is already a limited water supply
