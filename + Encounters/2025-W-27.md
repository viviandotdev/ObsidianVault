### Weekly Reflections 2025-W27

**In My Life** 
<!--What is going on in your life? -->
- I've not been feeling great because I am above my maintenance weight, I feel best around 108-112. At the start of this week I was at 119 lbs.
	- My plan to get back down to 108-112 is to walk ever morning 1-2 hours to get as many steps in as early as possible
	- **Goal** - **8-10k steps in total**
- I've started reading this week, i really do like to read it's like watching TV but its kinda better, i feel like now a days tv writing has become bad , books seem to be a little better it's not as cringe, there is no giant corporation behind it is usually just individual authors.
