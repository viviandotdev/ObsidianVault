### Weekly Reflections 2025-W27

**In My Life** 
<!--What is going on in your life? -->
- I've not been feeling great because I am above my maintenance weight, I feel best around 108-112. At the start of this week I was at 119 lbs.
	- My plan to get back down to 108-112 is to walk ever morning 1-2 hours to get as many steps in as early as possible
	- **Goal** - **8-10k steps in total**
- I've started reading this week, i really do like to read it's like watching TV but its kinda better, i feel like now a days tv writing has become bad , books seem to be a little better it's not as cringe, there is no giant corporation behind it is usually just individual authors. 


**Ideas**
<!-- Capture the ideas or thoughts that spark excitement-->
You need consequences to stop procrastination
I think you are way to comfortable and need to get out of this cycle, I think the main way is to get a new job, my goa is to be confident in my ability to find a job
Set millionaire deadlines, saying you will lose a certain amount of money if you miss the deadline 

Also I am having trouble focusing there is so many. Things to do I don’t know what to do or when to do it, I think I need to set up specific times or conditions of when to do something or else I am always paralyzed and can’t figure out what to do
- Create climbing video animation
