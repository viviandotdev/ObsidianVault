- my appetite /stomach still feels a little weid, like i really don't want to eat as much, i feel constantly bloated
- started reading this week, i really do like to read it's like watching TV but its kinda better, i feel like no a days tv is really bad like the writing on tv shows these days are so shit bro, books seem to be a little better it's not as cringe, there is no giant corporation behind it is usually just individual authors.
