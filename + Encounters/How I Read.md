**Overview**
**Capture**- read in kindle, raindrop.io or pdfs, 
	kindle annotations are found the book, create a script to read annotations from kindle books and put them in obsidian
**Review**- In obsidian i where you find the annotation for what you read/highlight, review them daily, using tick , tick as a list of what to review, **everyday spend 1 hour, in the tick ideas and clear out any books and videos**  this is where the notes on interesting articles and books start, when they are done put them into obsidian, while reviewing them put ideas into anki
**Integrate**- when you encounter information you like to remembers, mark them.  for ideas you want to remember, create a shortcut to create an anki card that is marked with a specific note type, to remember to turn into a more fine grained note
