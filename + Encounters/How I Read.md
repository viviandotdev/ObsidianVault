## How i read

**Overview**
Here's a restructured version of your content in Markdown, organized with headings and bullet points for clarity:

---

## Capture

- **Read in Kindle, Raindrop.io, or PDFs**
  - Kindle annotations are found in the book. Create a script to read annotations from Kindle books and put them in Obsidian.
- Use YouTube for research and watch later.
- **Read through Raindrop Articles**
- **Filter Your Newsletter List**
- **Read Books on List*
- **Compile Interesting People**
  - Find books they have read.

## Review

- **In Obsidian**
  - This is where you find the annotations for what you read/highlight. Review them daily using TickTick as a list of what to review.
  - **Every day, spend 1 hour in TickTick ideas and clear out any books and videos.** This is where the notes on interesting articles and books start. When they are done, put them into Obsidian. While reviewing them, put ideas into Anki.

- **Reconstruct Arguments**
- **Process Notes in TickTick**
- **Create Articles / Output**
- **Gather and Favorite Your Essays**
  - Store ideas that you love somewhere you can quickly review.

## Integrate

- **When You Encounter Information You Like to Remember**
  - Mark them. For ideas you want to remember, create a shortcut to create an Anki card that is **marked** with a specific note type. This helps you remember to turn it into a more fine-grained note.
  - Every week or so, at your computer, look through your marked cards (highlights) in Anki and turn them into Q&A style questions. Delete the highlighted note, keeping only things that are interesting and you actually want to remember.
