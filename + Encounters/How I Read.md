## How i read

**Overview**
Here's a restructured version of your content in Markdown, organized with headings and bullet points for clarity:

---

## Capture
**books** - read on kindle
**articles**- read from raindrop.io
	articles from newsletters
**videos**- watch on youtube (research channel)

## Review
**books** - create note in tick-tick tagged #book
	compile all your notes and thoughts about this book
**videos** - create note in tick tick taged #videos, include your notes on the video
**articles** -  create note in tick tick tagged article
	these are article you want to write note about.
  - **Every day, spend 1 hour in TickTick ideas and clear out any books and videos.** This is where the notes on interesting articles and books start. When they are done, put them into Obsidian. While reviewing them, put ideas into Anki.

- **Reconstruct Arguments**
- **Process Notes in TickTick**
- **Create Articles / Output**
- **Gather and Favorite Your Essays**
  - Store ideas that you love somewhere you can quickly review.

## Integrate

- **When You Encounter Information You Like to Remember**
  - Mark them. For ideas you want to remember, create a shortcut to create an Anki card that is **marked** with a specific note type. This helps you remember to turn it into a more fine-grained note.
  - Every week or so, at your computer, look through your marked cards (highlights) in Anki and turn them into Q&A style questions. Delete the highlighted note, keeping only things that are interesting and you actually want to remember.
