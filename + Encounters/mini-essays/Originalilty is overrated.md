Steal like an artist

people spend years copying work before they ever produce anything meaningful on their own

artitis will do master copies for years because they can even come up with anything good,

I think i will spend the next 5 years of my 20's just copying i will copy everyone and everything,
I will copy the people i want to become
I will copy the art that i Like 
I will copy the code from 
I will copy writining
