[[Anger is a fabricated tool, used to achieve a selfish egotistical goal to make someone else feel small]]

Freud believe that the past determined who we are today. This idea denies our free will and is driven by determinism. If our past determined everything and who we are today could not take steps forward to change our lives, we would end up in a kind of nihilism where we lose all hope.

Rather, as Adler’s teleology tells us, ‘No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on.’ That you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines your own life.

[[The important this is not what one is born with but what one makes use of that equipment]]


[[Lifestyle vs Personality ]]
You lifestyle is your personality
Lifestyle is the tendencies of thought and action in life. Your lifestyle essentially becomes your life
Lifestyle is more flexible whereas personality can sound fixed
People often think they are born with their personality and that can’t be changed and they use that as an excuse for why they can’t change
However in aderleran psychology your lifestyle is your personality.
Lifestyle is always changing
Your lifestyles when you were a kid is different from an adult
You have control over your lifestyle
To live a happy life you need to design a full filling lifestyle that you can sustain over a long period of time and that makes you happy

It requires a lot of courage to change your lifestyles
Changing your lifestyle will bring a lot of stress and anxiety.
Even if we don’t like our current situation we choose not to change because it feel’s familiar
