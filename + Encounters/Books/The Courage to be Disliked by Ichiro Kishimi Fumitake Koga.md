The courage to be disliked
-  idea about anger, people commonly think that anger is something that you canâ€™t control itâ€™s an emotions that pops out of no where and you need to express your self to let it out
- Anger is fabricated, it is created to fulfill a goal of yours

Feelings of inferiority is an excuse All of our problems are interpersonal relationship problems. Everything that we all conflict or are essentially interpersonal relationship conflicts. We humans are social creatures and every time we need to get something done itâ€™s because itâ€™s for someone else or based on other peoples but weâ€™re also always thinking about how other people are thinking about us which is an interpersonal relationship problem.

Her value and your inferiority complex is a internal interpersonal relationship problem because your value depends on how you think other see you or how you compare yourself to other people for example if you were alone in a world where there was nobody but yourself you wouldnâ€™t have these in fair inferiority complex problems because thereâ€™s no one else to compare yourself to for example, if I think Iâ€™m short thatâ€™s because I think that other people are taller than me which makes me believe that Iâ€™m sure however Iâ€™m the only person at short thereâ€™s no comparison there so I donâ€™t wouldnâ€™t even have that thought

Value with something thatâ€™s based on social context for example, the value of a dollar is not objective given the amount of resource that went into creating. It does not equal its exact work. Itâ€™s based on a social contract for example, if I had that dollar in the world all by myself , I would be using it to burn a fire during winter time because dollar inherently has no value without the social context behind it in the same way that feeling inferior to others based on my height is a subjective view because the. Because if I was the only person in the world, there were no there would be no reason for me to worry about my height.
