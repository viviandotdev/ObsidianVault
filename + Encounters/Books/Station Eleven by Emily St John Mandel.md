**What life lessons?**

I liked the book, I actually really like the structure of it was like a puzzle piece and as I read I was looking for the pieces that interconnected everyone.
We are all some how connected


**How did this make me feel?**
Grateful we still have the things we have like electricity 
We really take for granted all pf the things we have built
When the pandemic wiped out like 99 percent of the population people had to rebuild again 
They had to relearn everything
People we learning languages
Kids were being taught the concept of airplanes, electricity and ETC.

**What did you like about the book?**
I enjoyed the structure of the book it was like a mosaic.
I way satifying to see how each of the characters lives were are intertwined and connected 
It was like putting a puzzle piece together and it was nice when all the pieces fit together
