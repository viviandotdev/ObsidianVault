[[Commercial banks create money out of 'nothing']]

**Brain dump**
<!-- Brian dump -->
An economy system where the private companies owns the means of productions rather that the state, 
These private companies operate for a profit
In this system companies compete with each other motivating them to improve and make better product to creators profits

Why does capitalism succeed?
Capitalism works by incentivizing people to act in their own self-interest and making it as easy as possible to do so.Â 



How is money created?
When I want to start a business, I can ask a bank for loan of 50,000 for a tractor,
The bank creates this money from thin air, by typing it into the computer.
It is very difficult to believe that value can be born from nothing?
But why does this work?
How can value be created from nothing?
What is happening is the banker is essentially taking the 50000 from the future me who is already a successful business person and using that to invest in me in the present.
The bank enables us to borrowing from our future more successful selves by paying them a fee and interest.

This assumes that you will be successful in the future?

Bankers are not constrained to lend existing exchange value, they can lend future exchange value as well, 

This leads bankers to lend and lend because it creates more money for the ecnonmy and they take the profits if they are successful.


Banks also found a way to win even if the business fails,
Then can chop the loan up and sell it to investors who can own a share of the loan,
The bankers are now now longer liable for the load since they sold the loan to the investors and already made the 50,000 back,
The investors buy the loan because the bank will pay them higher interest then if just simply deposited the money but lower that the interest they charge the business owner
They still profit in interest because the difference in interest is what they still profit if the loan is successful and if it fails the investors are liable

So your saying the bankers donâ€™t provide anything really?
Your not even borrowing from the bank, your actually borrowing from you future self but paying interest to the bank?!

The large quantities of value borrowed from the future fail to materialize the economy collapses,

What are the chain of events that lean to an economic crash?
When things are looking good it incentivizes banks to lend out even more money, however the more you lend the more risky it is because not everyone will succeed and at some point the value you borrowed from the future will never materialize, as more businesses fail
Employees are laid off they workers have no money to buy from other shops causing other businesses to fail, therefore more and more loans pile up, since this is money the bank never had in the first place money and people lose trust and a bank run occurs when people all at the time take money out of the bank and the bank does not have enough money to repay them,
The bank cannot repay them because they donâ€™t have the cash, when they lent out with the loans they created from this air
People who are unemployed can no longer pay the loans back on their houses so the bank takes back the houses and people cannot afford the houses
So we get a shit ton of empty houses which crashes housing pricies

So what happens now?
The difference between the central bank and local bank is that the central bank goal is not to make profit, their role is to prevent economic colllapse and to save bankers

The central bank takes over and gives banks money.
 Central banks choose which banks to save?
Therefore they should be cautious how they lend and not abuse their powers
Bankers and politicians have a toxic relationship because they are often elected by bankers who offer large contributions.
In the government these politicians need bankers just as much. These bankers have no reason to be cautious 

When we canâ€™t pay our loans we create debt


What is the velocity of money and what does it say about capitalism?


Futures are similar concept to stock
You can buy some thing now betting it will go up in the future and sell it then for a profit
More money out on a loan than was actually circulating
