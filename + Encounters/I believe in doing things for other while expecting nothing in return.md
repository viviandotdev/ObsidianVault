**Relationships work when both parties are willing to do things for each other without expecting anything in return.**
- prevents resentment and disappointment
- Less expectations, less disappointment.

**There are no expectations within  friendships**
I do things for my friends not because it’s expected it’s because I want to. 
Within friendship there are no such expectations like I do

**Relationships have too much expectations**
Within a relationship there’s a lot of expectation for both parties. 
- you’re supposed to tell everyone your in a relationship, it’s like you have to announce to everyone
	- I don't like this attention
- you're supposed to tell your partner about everything you do

**Family Expectations**
Within a family there are also expectations
- you're obligated to give them money when they ask
	
	I choose NI have to even with family. I feel like they’re all of these expectations within the family, especially with money if my family asked me for money expected to give it I mean, of course I want to get to them, but it’s that expectation that makes me feel like I don’t want Like I don’t want to do it, but it feels like I’m forced to do it you know and I don’t like that feeling of being something I like the feeling of choice expectations are like something I feel like I have to do and I don’t like doing things I have to do I like doing things that I want to do
Also, relationships are likely to survive. At least one party is able to compromise when both parties give up and are willing compromise relationship.
