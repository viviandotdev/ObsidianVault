**Relationships work when both parties are willing to do things for each other without expecting anything in return.**
- prevents resentment and dissapointmenet 
This is bec
I do things for my friends not because it’s expected it’s because I want to. Within a relationship there’s a lot of expectation for both. For example you’re supposed to tell everyone your in a relationship, it’s like you have to announce to everyone. I find it kind of weird like Within friendship there are no such expectations like I do because I choose NI have to even with family. I feel like they’re all of these expectations within the family, especially with money if my family asked me for money expected to give it I mean, of course I want to get to them, but it’s that expectation that makes me feel like I don’t want Like I don’t want to do it, but it feels like I’m forced to do it you know and I don’t like that feeling of being something I like the feeling of choice expectations are like something I feel like I have to do and I don’t like doing things I have to do I like doing things that I want to do
Also, relationships are likely to survive. At least one party is able to compromise when both parties give up and are willing compromise relationship.
