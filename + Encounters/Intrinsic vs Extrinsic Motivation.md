## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation

**Value what the worlds does to you**
- experiences and the pleasures of life
- Feelings, money success life
- Not the goal
**Value what you do to the world** (the better way to think about life)
- self determination theory, 
- Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
- The value of the thing is the reward of the thing is itself
- Our generation is mostly extrinsicly motivations it is unfullfiling  and makes you bad at it

Intrinsic Motivations comes from 
- autonomy
    - You are doing it because you want to
- Competence
    - You are good at or getting better at it
- Relatedness
    - There is need for it in the world, being relevant for something bigger than yourself
		Cultivating related ness



Build something just to prove to myself that I can, don't do it for the users, or money, do it because you can
