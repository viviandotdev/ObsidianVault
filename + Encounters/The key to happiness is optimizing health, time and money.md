## The key to happiness is optimizing health, time and money

When you’re young and healthy, you can do more. By doing more, you’re actually taking on more and more desires. You don’t realize this is slowly destroying your happiness. I find younger people are less happy but more healthy. Older people are more happy but less healthy. When you’re young, you have time. You have health, but you have no money. When you’re middle-aged, you have money and you have health, but you have no time. When you’re old, you have money and you have time, but you have no health. 

**So the trifecta is trying to get all three at once.** 
By the time people realize they have enough money, they’ve lost their time and their health.
