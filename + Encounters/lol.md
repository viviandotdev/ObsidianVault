Its matters not the record but the activity itself


I’m caring too much about the record of keep and searching everything but that doesn’t not matter

AI has made it easier than every to find what you are looking for


System become crutches and override our own judgement of what actually helps what what just becomes system matinence


It also does not matter if your contribution is actually useful


It is the act of feeling that you have contributed is enough to be happy y\

It’s actually much easier to be happy than most people think 

I think most people see that success and that they can finally be happy when they have all the things that don’t have now


But the happiness is in the jouney, if you enjoy what you are doing now that is enough


The end is that what makes you happy it’s process and progress you see that actually makes you happy
