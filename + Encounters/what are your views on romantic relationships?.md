## what are your views on romantic relationships?

**what is love to you?**
Love is caring about someone despite their flaws, I donâ€™t think it is a special feeling
You love your family members and will consistently choose them despite the flaws. It makes it very difficult to let go of family members.

**do you care more to be loved or loved?**


I don't like all the expectation of being in a relationship, 
I don't like the idea of someone liking me because they are physically attracted to me, I want to be liked for the way that they make me feel not
