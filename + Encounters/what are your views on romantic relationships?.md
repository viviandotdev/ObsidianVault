## what are your views on romantic relationships?

**what is love to you?**
Love is caring about someone despite their flaws, I donâ€™t think it is a special feeling
You love your family members and will consistently choose them despite the flaws. It makes it very difficult to let go of family members.

**do you care more to be loved or loved?**


**why i don't want a relationship**
- I don't like all the expectation of being in a relationship, 
- Approaching me and being so forward about liking me when I just met someone, I think feels kind of weird
- Dating apps are weird because what do you mean I'm supposed to know if I am romantically attracted to someone based on a picture and some questions?
- I don't like the idea of someone liking me because they are physically attracted to me, I want to be liked for the way we make each other feel.
	- They should make me feel secure and calm
- I feels like they want to take something from me,
