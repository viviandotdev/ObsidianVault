Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order** 
Remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**.
- sorted array (two pointer?)
- remove duplicates (keep track of count??)
	- since the array is sorted, we can use the previous pointer to find duplicates because duplicates will all be next to each other
The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.
- how to keep relative order the same?
	- if we see a duplicate keep the pointer at the same place and replace it until we find a non duplicate
what are the two pointers? slow and fast pointer
they start at i(0) and i + 1  (1)
**slow pointer** -> the pointer that the finder pointer compares to
**fast pointer** -> the pointer that looks for the non duplicates
duplicate flag?
conditions
	 if 
			
Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.
- k = number of unique elements in nums, 

**Summary**
Change the array so duplicates are removed and that the first k elements are unique (no - dups) and maintain the order they appear in the array
The remaining elements can be anything

2 pointers
