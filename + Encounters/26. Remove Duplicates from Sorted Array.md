Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order** 
Remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**.
- sorted array (two pointer?)
- remove duplicates (keep track of count??)
	- since the array is sorted, we can use the previous pointer to find duplicates because duplicates will all be next to each other
The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.
- how to keep relative order the same?
	- if we see a duplicate keep the pointer at the same place and replace it until we find a non duplicate

2 pointers
stationary pointer -> the pointer that 
finder pointer -> the pointer that looks for duplicates
Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Change the array so duplicates are removed and that the first k elements are unique (no - dups) and maintain the order they appear in the array
The remaining elements can be anything
