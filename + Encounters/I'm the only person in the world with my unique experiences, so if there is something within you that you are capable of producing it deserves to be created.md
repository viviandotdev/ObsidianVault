## I'm the only person in the world with my unique experiences, so if there is something within you that you are capable of producing it deserves to be created 

You are the only person who can and will ever create it

The value in art is not how many people see it, the value comes from how many people couldn't have created what you can.

Build something just to prove to myself that I can, don't do it for the users, or money, 
you ever build something
just to prove to yourself
you can?

not for users
not for money
just to win the mental battle.
