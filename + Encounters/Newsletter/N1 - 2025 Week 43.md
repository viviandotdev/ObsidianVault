**In My Life**
- This month has been rough, I was sick all month and work has been hectic. There are so many changes going on and releases happening. 
- I've been [[drawing]] more this week, I went the Taco character drawing book, following the advice from [Resources for studying Art - HackMD](https://artstudies.neocities.org/#How-to-learn-to-draw-for-beginners)
	- My figure drawing is improving, gesture drawing feels hard though

**3 Ideas**
