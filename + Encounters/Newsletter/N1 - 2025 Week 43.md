**In My Life**
- This month has been rough, I was sick all month and work has been hectic. There are so many changes going on and releases happening. 
- I've been [[drawing]] more this week, I went the Taco character drawing book, following the advice from [Resources for studying Art - HackMD](https://artstudies.neocities.org/#How-to-learn-to-draw-for-beginners)
	- My figure drawing is improving, gesture drawing feels hard though

**Ideas**
	[[The act of creating is more important than what is created]]
		The joy that you get from creating is enough of a reason to create. 
		Don't create for the money or attention, create just for yourself
	[[I consider myself ambitions in the sense that I want to see what I am capable of given the mind and body I was born with]]
	

**Curiosity**
- Interested in reading more fiction and literature
	- classics, sci-fi and thrillers
- Economics, understanding the different structure of the US and China and how it lead to different outcomes in progress between the two countries in the last decades.

**Tools & Experiments**
- Listening to audio books on Snipd, this has been helping me read more books. I listen to the book while drawing and then skim and read it again on my kindle searching for the ideas that resonated with me.


**Articles**
- [[Does the Future Belong to China?]]


**Books**
- [[Station Eleven by Emily St John Mandel]]
- I who have never known man
