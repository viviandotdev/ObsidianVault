- Largest or second largest famine in the human history
- The [[Great Leap Forward]] was overwhelmingly a failure: it did not succeed as intended, and its legacy is mainly one of human suffering and economic collapse


**what was the goal of the great leap forward?**
- Collectivizing agriculture 
	- Instead of working on their own plots for individual profit ([[capitalism]]), farmers would work on larger farms, sharing resources, equipment and often profits. However the majority of the profits went to the state. [[communism]]
	- **Consequences**
		- Peasants lost the incentive to work hard since the profits were. mostly taken by the state
		- Lack of motivation and mismanagement caused the collective farms to be less productive.
- Promoting widespread industrialization, with two main targets—increasing grain and steel production. 
	- the steel production campaign, produced useless pig iron and diverted from agriculture, people could not industrialize if they were starving
	- 
**why did he think this was a good idea?**

- Leaders Lui Shaoqi and DengXiaoping stepped up t o emphaisized, practical results and economic stability and reversed Mao's ideas 
- De-collectivization, peasants could start private farms again.
