## How to build a visual library

**Exercise- Memory Drawing or Cognitive Drawing**
1. Choose an object to study
2. Gather reference pictures of that object, find references of every angle and make sure they are high resolution so we can zoom in
3. 
4. (Optional)- Reference your favorite artists that apply the same rendering process or style on your studies.
