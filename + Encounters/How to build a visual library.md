## How to build a visual library

**Exercise- Memory Drawing or Cognitive Drawing**
1. Choose an object to study
2. Gather reference pictures of that object, find references of every angle and make sure they are high resolution so we can zoom in
3. Draw the object from reference
4. Draw the object from memory
5. Correct any mistakes
6. Draw the object again from reference
7. Draw the object from memory (repeat until memorized)
8. If you like drawing it add it to your anki deck
9. (Optional)- Reference your favorite artists that apply the same rendering process or style on your studies.
