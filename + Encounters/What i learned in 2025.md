[[Life Reflections]]


**What moments or experiences defined 2025 for me?**
	I built consistency with climbing
	Started actually working as QA Automation Engineer, first year i actually felt i was working the first two years i was just coasting and getting by without doing much
**Areas**
==**health**==
- Gained some weight this year i would like to shed.
	- what caused this?
		- I was busy for a good chunk of this year with work, the oneview project was stressful not because i felt stressed but because other people were pushing their stress on to me.
		- When i climbed hard i would do nothing the next day which led to some weight gain, i also feel stronger so there is muscle as well
			==improve== To fix this I will try to practice some calisthenics on my days off.
==**work**==
- **Did not work much on my personal projects this year**, however i did work more and I learned a lot about the process of building software and will apply these to my own projects
	==improve== - focus less on work, optimize your work and spend more time on personal projects 
==**relationships**==
- made some friends this year from climbing, josephine, zach, kaitlyn and raph
	- went on an outdoor climbing trip and few hikes, they were fun and I would like to do more of them this year in the spring/fall, rock scrambles were fun
	==**maintain**== work on maintaining your relationships 



**Apply Climbing Mindset to anything I do** 
**Climbing has taught me a lot about how **

- ==Consistency,== with climbing I can be consistent without even trying this is what it feels to like to find something you really like doing, it should feel easy and not hard
- ==Perfectionism==, with each session, I don’t expect it to be the best, I just show up and do what I always do and trust the process and that I will improve
    - With climbing I am not worried about finding the most efficient way of doing things, I do it because I enjoy and that is enough for me.
    - However when coding , I have such decision fatigue and worry about finding the best way to do something and if I can’t figure out the best way I want do it at all.
        - I want to find the best frameworks
        - I want to find the best code structure,  because I am afraid of what people will think when they look at my code. But with climbing I don’t seem to give a shit what people think or if I’m a bad climber
        - I should have the same mindset with my code, don’t give a shit write as much shitty code as possible, there is so much shitty code that is writing in production, some of the most popular games have such shitty code inside of them, as long as it works people don’t really care about how it is made as long as it is useful to them
- ==Progress is not linear,== even though the progress is not linear I still do it anyway to maintain, even though you are not progressing it does not mean you should stop
- ==The act of climbing is more important than the projects you send==
    - The act of coding is more important that the products,
