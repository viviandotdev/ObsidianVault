### Weekly Reflections 2025-W28

**In My Life** 
<!--What is going on in your life? -->
- Work was busy this past week, with Shravan leaving the team I am doing the work of the UI Automation and also helping out with API automation. However it has been difficult to keep track of everything.
- Climbing was fun this week, I feel like I am improving again and getting that same excitement I was feeling last summer. At Vital was able to complete 2 Red climbs and working 3 more as well,  at Gowanus we mostly worked on the v5 and v6.

**Ideas**
<!-- Capture the ideas or thoughts that spark excitement for you-->
