How to not be socially awkward

  

  

1. Active listening

1. Be genuinely curious about what they are talking about
2. When people say something they often leave out a lot of context, so just ask more questions

1. Ex. I cut my hand on Sunday while working on a car.

1. What kind of car?
2. Was it your car
3. How did you cut it?
4. Can I see it?, did it hurt
5. Do you work on cars?
6. Do you work on cars often on Sundays?

3. Ex. I like to watch Tour de France

1. Do you know when the competition is?
2. Where do you watch it? Just clips on YouTube?
3. How fast are they going on those bikes?
4. Do know how to ride bikes?
5. What time of year is it? is it going on now?


3. ex. I went to korea?
	1. do you live in korea?
	2. how long have you lived there?
	3. do your parents live there?
	4. do you like living there?
