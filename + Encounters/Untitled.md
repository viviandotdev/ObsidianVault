career paths of successful creatives further underscore the power of self-imposed limits over fixed goals

Feel like you doing something

Avoid setting explicit goal
Goals are a winning condition
Constraints are the rules of the game
Stop trying to win
Self imposed strcuture,
Start with a frame
Setting goals feel like action, build a notion dashboard,
Set goals, proxy for direction
Invsiible constraints are what matters
Contraints, force you think about what is possbile from here
Instead of how to get there
Contraints are adaptive
Sets a goal  -> of becomming a best selling author
set a Constraints -> write every day never write what bores me
