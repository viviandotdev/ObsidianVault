**By not committing to something you can fall back on the illusion that if I tried I can do it**

This is a mindset I have fallen for often
I have never really gave anything my best shot because of the fear of failure and criticism
I thunk I know where my fear of criticism comes from and I need to let it go
I’m going to try and give it my best shot and do it for me because I think it’s cool and that’s enough for me

For example Novelist's Excuse

A young friend who dreams of becoming a novelist says, his job keeps him too busy, and he can never find enough time to write novels, and that’s why he can’t complete work and enter it for writing awards. But is that the real reason? No!

It’s actually that he wants to leave the possibility of **‘I can do it if I try’ open, by not committing to anything.** He doesn’t want to expose his work to criticism, and he certainly doesn’t want to face the reality that he might produce an inferior piece of writing and face rejection.
