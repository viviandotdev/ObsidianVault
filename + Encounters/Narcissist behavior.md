**Narcissist behavior** 

- it is exhausting, when things don’t go their way, 
- Mae everything about themselves, picking the destination controlling the itinerary 
- Create so much drama over the smallest inconvenience 
- Bad weather, waiting in a long line, too much people becomes like a personal crisis 
- Their frustration overshadowed any enjoyment that I would have 
- Have unrealistic expectations, perfect weather, or food,  basically everything needs to go right and any small issue they would lash out and make you deal with the problem
- CONSTANT criticism on the trip
- Bro the criticism started before we even went on the trip,
- Dad was already criticizing the length of the trip, why didn’t we stay an extra day,
- [[Vicky]] the second mom showed where we are going she criticized the place saying there will be long lines, she would not have a good time, that’s why your not going dummy, she already criticizing my packing and telling me about the water rule bro I haven’t even got a suitcase yet
- Instead of relaxing I’m just thinking about the next complaint and worried what might trigger them to get upset
