Design a fully-featured open forum platform UI that reimagines community discussion for 2025. The interface should be complex but clean, packed with rich UX features, modular design elements, and real-time interactions — all without clutter. The goal is to create a premium, immersive discussion environment that blends modern web app smoothness with deep, structured dialogue.  ⸻  🔹 Layout & Structure •Full-screen desktop layout with 3-column grid: •Left: Community navigation, trending tags, personal bookmarks •Center: Live-updating discussion feed with stacked cards •Right: Active threads, AI-suggested replies, “Start New Post” CTA •Mobile view collapses to bottom navigation with gestures and tabbed browsing (like Slack + Twitter hybrid).  ⸻   Post Card UI (Main Feed) •Cards are modular blocks: •Title, summary, tags, author, vote count •Post type indicator ( Question /  Voice /  AMA) •Hover state: subtle glow + contextual quick actions (Save, Mute, Translate) •Live thread indicator:  Pulse animation if active replies are ongoing •Thread preview: Hover shows live replies in a tooltip or modal side-drawer without navigation interruption  ⸻   Multimodal Composer •Supports: rich text, markdown, voice note input, image embeds, video •Live AI assist: title suggestions, tone check, emoji enhancer •Local autosave + draft sync across devices • AI Auto-Summarizer •Each long thread has a collapsible AI summary (“In this thread…”) • Following” •“ Add another POV” •“ Reply Layers & Timeline •Replies are layered like a time-stack, with vertical timeline on side •Each layer can collapse/expand smoothly •Show disagreement as branching conversation lines (like Figma comments) • Inline Polls & Microinteractions •React to posts with more than emojis: Vote on outcomes, support decisions, approve resources •Each microreaction contributes to “community vibe” score  ⸻   Smart Topic Sidebar •Organizes content by: •Interests (e.g., Design, Wellness, Philosophy) •Vibe (e.g., Deep Reads, Fun Stuff, Rants) •Format (e.g., Threads, Stories, AMAs, Tools) • “Help Radar” •Surface questions that haven’t been answered •Highlight users who match expertise (tagged as “Best to answer”) • User Profile / Gamification •Profiles show: •Stats: Thoughts Shared, Insights Given, Replies Received, Replies Summarized by AI •“Community roles”: Synthesizer, Challenger, Motivator •Badge system with a focus on behavior (e.g. “Asked 5 Brave Questions”)  ⸻  Visual Direction •Minimal but not flat — depth through layered cards, shadows, frosted-glass sidebars •Typography: Sleek, premium sans-serif (Satoshi, Neue Montreal, or Inter) •Color palette: Warm grayscale base + dynamic accent color based on thread mood (calm = blue, hot = orange, deep = violet) •Animations: •Smooth card expansion •Swipe-to-reply or swipe-to-bookmark •Subtle glow or burst when thread hits milestone  ⸻   Bonus Features • Post Analytics (Public) •Views over time, top referrers (e.g. Twitter, newsletter), engagement curve • Thread Templates •Choose “Debate”, “Deep Dive”, “AMA”, “Help Me Decide”, or “Feedback Loop” formats that structure the post UI accordingly
