- **Science of Reducing Hunger:** Learn how to decrease overall hunger long-term to burn fat, keep it off, and maintain high mental clarity and energy levels.
- **3 Science-Backed Secrets for Easier Multi-Day Fasting:**
  - **TRT and Ghrelin:** Understand the decrease of the hunger hormone, ghrelin, during fasting. [Study Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15522942/)

**Solution to Post-Weight Loss Hunger:**

- **Hormonal Changes:** Prevent increased hunger after weight loss by staying in ketosis.
- **Ketosis Benefits:** Fasting increases ketones, allowing sustenance on an 800-calorie diet after two weeks. This is the principle behind the keto diet.

- **Upton Sinclair Fasting Protocol:** Hunger disappears for a few days during total fasting but eventually returns.
- If you are worried about losing muscle during fasting, ketones actually help preserve muscle

	- yes but your brain can also survive off on ketone bodies![[Screenshot 2024-10-27 at 7.49.35 PM.png]]
**Benefits of Fasting:**
- Raises ketones
- Reduces seizures
- Improves depression
- Lowers anxiety, inflammation, pain, and allergies


**Fasting Hormones:**
- BDNF, insulin, ghrelin, growth hormone


Fasting -> Fat Adaption (PPAR(alpha))-> Less Hunger ([[PPAR-alpha]])
Getting the body to use it own body tissue for energy (fat adapation)
	when you do multiple fasts your bad gets fat adapted can you can 

Fasting gets easier
PPAR induces fat adaption

**#1 Start the Fast in Ketosis:**

- **Preparation:** Eat a low-carb/keto diet for a week beforehand to ease the fasting process.
- **Carb Tapering:** Gradually reduce carbs over the week.
- **Exercise:** Engage in low-intensity steady exercise, like walking, to reduce carbohydrate stores and preserve muscle.

**#2 Avoid Fasting Fatigue:**

- **Sodium Loss:** Fasting leads to sodium loss, causing fatigue, nausea, low energy, and muscle weakness.
  - Avoid saunas and excessive water intake, which can flush out electrolytes.
  - Include sodium in your water to prevent fatigue.
  - **Salt Intake:** Higher salt intake (4000 mg = 12 grams) may lower heart disease risk.
- **Electrolyte Balance:** Ensure a balance of magnesium and potassium with sodium.
- **Hot Salty Broth:** A miso soup or hot salty drink can help overcome fasting challenges.

**Secret #4: Increase Energy and Build Lean Muscle**

- **Breaking the Fast:** Avoid watery carbs like watermelon and congee.
- **Refeed on Lean Protein:** Helps IGF-1 levels rise again.
- **Refeed Protocol:** Follow a feast and fast protocol for optimal results.
