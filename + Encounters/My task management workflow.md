## My task management workflow

**Tool - Tick Tick**

Philosophy
- I don't really have the to do list, Cal NewPort does not use a to do list, he views time blocks in the day for a certain activity
- Within that block you will tackle list of items for that activity
- You should organize tasks by when you are. going to o them not projects
- You may have a thousand things to do but you are still constraed by time 
- It does not matter how many tasks you have, what matters if you have the time to do them
