## My task management workflow

**Tool - Tick Tick**

**Philosophy**
- I don't really have the to do list, Cal NewPort does not use a to do list, he views time blocks in the day for a certain activity
	- Within that block you will tackle list of items for that activity
- **You should organize tasks by when you are going to do them not projects**
- You may have a thousand things to do but you are still constrained by time 
**It does not matter how many tasks you have, what matters if you have the time to do them**

**Weekly planing**
- create a weekly plan
