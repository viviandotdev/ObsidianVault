## My obsidian workflow

### Daily time block for writing
- Start off your mornings with reading and taking notes
- I'm going to bring that habit back by spending an hour after my morning routine to partake in some deep work to explore my curiosities.
- Set an intention for my learning and during the periods work active [[note-taking]], note-making or making connections between notes

### Throughout the day, log anything significant that comes to mind
- After each work period create a daily note to log everything you did and then sub-bullets for details

### At the end of the day do some house keeping of your notes
-
