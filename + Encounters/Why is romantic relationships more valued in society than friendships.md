- We go to school to get **indoctrinated** on how to contribute and participate as a consumer in this capitalism economy.  [^1]
- In school we are taught to learn that we need to go to work and to go to work we need to find a job to support your family

The idea of creating the nuclear family is what fuels our economy. The things that society tells you to want actually just traps you in a job 
Then with that someone you create children which we need to take care of which motivates us to work more to be able to support them

We are taught go to school -> get job -> make money
Why do we need to make money?
	-> to buy a house
	-> to support our family
How do we create a family?



Friendship do not produce workers, we don’t need to support our friends, they support themselves

If you don’t fall in love -> you don’t have a family -> if you don’t have a family you are not motivated to work -> if you are not motivated to work then there is not labor force to support the economy 

**Indoctrination** - teach people to accept a set of beliefs uncritically
