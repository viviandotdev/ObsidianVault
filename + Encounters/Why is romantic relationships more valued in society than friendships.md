## Why is romantic relationships more valued in society than friendships

Why is romantic relationships more valued in society than friendships
Indoctrination, we need
We go to school to get indoctrinated,i don’t feel lonely because I have good friends or I like spending time with myself
Romantic relationship is what fuels the economy,
In school we are taught to learn that we need to go to work and to go to work we need to find a job to support your family
How do we get a family you need to fall in love with someone
Then with that someone you create children which we need to take care of which motivates us to work more to be able to support them

Friendship do not produce workers, we don’t need to support our friends, they support themselves

If you don’t fall in love -> you don’t have a family -> if you don’t have a family you are not motivated to work -> if you are not motivated to work then there is not labor force to support the economy 

We need romanic relationship to create value?
Society overvalues pressure to get married,
