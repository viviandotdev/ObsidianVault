## Highlights
School has clear rules. Life often doesn’t. When there’s no clear path to follow, academic high achievers break down.
Shawn Achor’s research at Harvard shows that college grades aren’t any more predictive of subsequent life success than rolling dice. A study of over seven hundred American millionaires showed their average college GPA was 2.9.

---
kids who were raised in rough environments, who were abused or neglected, were more likely to become alcoholics and bullies. But children who received good parenting were even kinder than kids who had the standard DRD4 gene. Context made the difference.

---
Most people are dandelions; they’ll come out okay under almost any circumstances. Others are orchids; they’re not just more sensitive to negative outcomes but more sensitive to everything. 

---
Too often we label things “good” or “bad” when the right designation might merely be “different.”

---
Impulsivity is a generally negative trait frequently mentioned in the same sentence as “violent” and “criminal,” but it also has a clear link to creativity.

---
But for some, as Dan Coyle points out in The Talent Code, researchers theorize that such a tragedy instills in a child the feeling that the world is not safe and that an immense amount of energy and effort will be needed to survive.

---
Consider the people we’re all envious of who can confidently pick something, say they’re going to be awesome at it, and then calmly go and actually be awesome at it. This is their secret: they’re not good at everything, but they know their strengths and choose things that are a good fit. 

---
“What are you good at that consistently produces desired results?”

---
Studies show expecting others to be untrustworthy creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. You assume they’ll behave badly, so you stop trusting, which means you withhold effort and create a downward spiral. It’s not surprising that work teams with just one bad apple experience performance deficits of 30 to 40 percent.

---
Once trust goes, everything goes. What quality do people, when surveyed across a
number of arenas—work, athletic teams, family members—say they desire most in others? Trustworthiness.

---
Then I looked at the other end of the spectrum and said if Givers are at the bottom, who’s at the top? Actually, I was really surprised to discover, it’s the Givers again. The people who consistently are looking for ways to help others are overrepresented not only at the bottom but also at the top of most success metrics

---
The Effect of One Bad Apple on the Barrel.” When you see your peers cheat, you’re more likely to cheat. And when your peers see each other cheat, everyone is more likely to bend the rules. That’s one step closer to Moldova.

---
Even TFT, the eventual winner, always got the short end of the stick early on because it cooperated initially. But as time passed, the bad guys couldn’t match the big gains of the cooperators.

---
Axelrod and others saw that going from straight tit for tat to “generous tit for tat” made the program even more successful

---
Again, most of life isn’t zero-sum. Just because someone else wins, that doesn’t mean you lose

---
All TFT did was cooperate on the first Prisoner’s Dilemma round, then in every subsequent round, it did whatever the opponent did previously—that is, if on the previous round the opponent cooperated, it cooperated on the next round; if the opponent betrayed, it betrayed on the next roun

---
Rather than always repeating the opponent’s last move, it would occasionally forgive and cooperate after being betrayed. While this led to it losing a
couple more points to evil programs like ALL D, those points were more than made up for by the generous TFT’s tremendous gains pulling potentially nice programs out of death spirals.

---
People less tolerant of unethical behavior had a higher well-being than those who were okay with a big dose of cheating. The boost was equivalent to the happiness increase one would get from a small increase in income, getting hitched, and going to church regularly.

---
What’s the best predictor of your child’s emotional well-being? It’s not great schools, hugs, or Pixar movies. Researchers at Emory University found that whether a
kid knew their family history was the number-one indicator.

---
Whiny neutered goats fly. Picture it in your mind. You’ve just learned what all good games have in common: WNGF. They’re Winnable. They have Novel challenges and Goals, and provide Feedback.

---
If you are immune to boredom, there is literally nothing you cannot accomplish.” In many ways, this is very true. If you never got bored, you’d be a
big step closer to being a computer.

---
Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.”

---
It sounds morbid, but people who contemplate the end actually behave in healthier ways—and therefore may actually live longer. It also has been shown to increase self-esteem. You want to talk about “big picture” thinking?

---
By engaging in cognitive reappraisal, and telling ourselves a
different story about what is happening, we can subvert the entire willpower paradigm.

---
Games change the struggle to something else. They make the process fun, and as Mischel showed in his research, we are able to persist far longer and without the same level of teeth-gritting willpower depletion.

---
The office often feels like a game that’s not winnable. You don’t feel you have control. You don’t feel like what you do makes much of a difference. Who wants to play that
game? Research by Dan Ariely showed that when we feel like what we do is futile or pointless, motivation and happiness plummet. 

---
We crave ease, but stimulation is what really makes us happy. We try to subtract at work, do less, check out. These are signs of burnout. We don’t need to subtract; we need to add novel challenges to create engagement.

---
But if you make your game winnable, setting goals will be less scary. Failure is okay in a
game. As Nicole Lazarro discovered, failure in a
game just makes things more fun.

---
As it turns out, yes . . . When we’re playing a well-designed game, failure doesn’t disappoint us. It makes us happy in a very particular way: excited, interested, and most of all optimistic

---
flow was most reliably and most efficiently produced by the specific combination of self-chosen goals, personally optimized obstacles, and continuous feedback that make up the essential structure of gameplay.

---
Research shows that the most motivating thing is progress in meaningful work.

---
You can’t get what you want until you take the time to decide
what you want.

---
Mihály Csikszentmihályi calls “flow,” which is when we’re immersed in something enough to forget the passage of time. We’re never bored or overwhelmed because good games keep a
perfect balance of hard but not too hard, easy but never too easy. And as we improve, games up the difficulty. We’re always stretching our abilities just enough to keep us hooked. McGonigal explains:

---
What one thing can I
do to make progress on important work tomorrow?” It gives you a
goal to shoot for. Give yourself a
clear idea of how to measure or achieve that, like Joe Simpson’s twenty minutes, and you’re on your way to a
motivating system.

---
Life satisfaction is 22 percent more likely for those with a
steady stream of minor accomplishments than those who express interest only in major accomplishments.”

---
The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.

---
We’re consistently conservative about predicting how much extra cash we’ll have in our wallets, but when it comes to time, we always think there will be more tomorrow. Or next week. Or next year.

---
To make it simple, we’ll say it’s 100.We need the square root of that number

---
optimal stopping problem.

---
First, take a
guess at the number of different people you might go out with.

---
Time does not equal money, because we can get more money.

---
Now go out on dates with 10 people and politely tell them “No, thanks,” but make sure to note who was the best of the bunch. Keep dating until you find somebody who rocks your world more than that person did.

---
This was their system: prototype and test, prototype and test, prototype and test—until the time was up. When there is no set path, this system wins

---
The study showed they are more open to new experiences, more extroverted, and less neurotic. They listen to their hunches. Most of all, Wiseman says, lucky people just try stuff

---
 Fantasizing gives us the reward before we’ve accomplished the task and saps the energy we need to realize it. More dreams now mean less achievement later.

---
 Early on, “love marriages” are happier than arranged marriages, scoring a 70 out of 91 on an academic “love scale” vs. 58 out of 91. No surprise, right? But later something happens. A
decade in, arranged marriages score a 68 and the ones based on love a
lowly 40

---
That distance you feel with your friend’s issues shifts them from emotionally fraught problems to fun challenges.

---
There are a
lot more extroverts than introverts, and the extroverts have more friends and talk more. As Susan Cain points out, an extrovert bias has crept into our workplaces, schools, and culture, especially in the United States.

---
Neuroscientist Diana Tamir found that your brain gets more pleasure from you talking about yourself than it does from food or money. This is why you should stop doing it and let others do it as much as possible around you

---
 You probably met the vast majority of your friends through a
handful of “superfriends”—the buddies of yours who are most like Panda. So when it comes to trying to expand your network and make new friends, do what works. If you look at your Facebook friends or address book contacts, you’ll find that you met many of them through a
small group of people. Reaching out to these “superfriends” and saying, “Whom do you know that I
should meet?” will produce disproportionate results

---
If they come up with a
solution, they’re more likely to follow through with it. They don’t have to concede defeat and say “You’re right.” They’ll be less defensive if they solve their own problem.

---
When the year was over, a
friend asked Walter, “What did you get from this?” He realized he hadn’t really thought about that. He blurted out the first idea in his head: peace of mind.

---
Help them solve their own problem by asking questions, feeding their responses back to them, and subtly helping them consider whether what they’re saying makes sense.

---
They are. Beautiful women bring in 4 percent more money and handsome men claim an extra 3 percent. That may not sound like much, but for the average worker that’s more than $230,000 over the course of a
career. Meanwhile, unattractive women earn 3 percent less and unattractive men take home a
whopping 22 percent less

---
What would you like me to do?” This forces them to consider options and think instead of just vent.Pretend to be Socrates. Don’t solve their problem and tell them what to do. That puts you back in a
war metaphor.

---
Ones that start with “what” or “how” are best because it’s very hard to answer them with just yes or no.

---
When people are riled up about something and you show them evidence that conflicts with what they believe, what does an MRI scan show? The areas of their brain associated with logic literally shut down. The regions associated with aggression light up. As far as their brain is concerned, it’s not a
rational discussion—it’s war. The brain can’t process what you’re saying; it’s just trying to win

---
Then hedonic adaptation set in. He found himself getting frustrated by little things again—traffic, computer problems. Once again, he took being alive for granted. Just like we all do.

---
Respond to their emotions by saying “Sounds like you’re angry” or “Sounds like this really upsets you.” Hostage negotiators use this to show understanding and to cool hot emotions.

---
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a
present and not giving it.” Walter had given the present. He had found peace and love. And those things are so much better when you’ve still got years ahead of you to enjoy them. And share them.

---
They’re not terrorists making demands (although sometimes it seems like that too). Usually they’re just upset. They just want to be heard.

---
Explaining is almost always veiled dominance. You’re not trying to educate; you’re still trying to win. The subtext is, “Here’s why I
am right and you are wrong.” And that is exactly what the other side will hear no matter what you say.

---
Empathy. Domestic disputes and suicidal individuals don’t respond well to people who sound like salesmen. Being sincere and focusing on emotions, however, leads to effective resolutions.

---
Even if you have rock-solid evidence and impeccable logic, and you back the other person into a
corner, what happens? They might concede—but they definitely hate you. When we make it win-or-lose, everyone loses

---
Don’t judge anything they say. Just listen and acknowledge. Every now and then paraphrase back to them what you’re hearing. Your goal is for them to reply “Exactly.”

---
In other words, they do not feel like victims of fate. They see their success as a
function of their own motivation and ability—not luck, random chance, or fate. They carry this belief even when luck does play a
crucial role in success.

---
“The secret of leadership was the ability to play a role, to pretend, to be skilled in the theatrical arts . . . To come across effectively, we need to master how to convey power.”

---
Become great at what you do and confidence will increase. Which leads us to our next point .

---
Studies show feelings of power cause us to be more selfish and more likely to commit infidelity

---
 You can feel good and perform well while not turning into a jerk or being unable to improve. Unlike self-confidence, self-compassion doesn’t lead to delusion.

---
We need optimism and confidence to keep going and convince others to join our cause, but negativity and pessimism help us see problems so we can make them better.

---
Power reduces empathy, makes us hypocritical, and causes us to dehumanize others.

---
Don’t beat yourself up or be critical when things don’t go your way.

---
Who is the only person in your life who is available 24/7 to provide you with care and kindness? "You.” You also want to accept your humanity. You are fallible. You don’t have to be perfect all the time like Batman, Trying to be is irrational, and that’s what leads to all the frustrating emotions

---
Studies show that taking the time to jot down nice thoughts to yourself, how you’re a
fallible human and how you can see problems without turning them into emotional disasters, made people feel better and increased self-compassion.

---
Powerful positions need to make hard decisions that may be bad in the short term but good in the long term. Generals need to send soldiers into harm’s way to win a war. If they felt paralyzing guilt over every loss of life, there’d be no way they could do the right thing. 

---
Her grey matter is very different, though. The disease causes parts of the brain to calcify; they actually harden and die. Often it’s the amygdala, the area most associated with fear. 

---
Without those stress cues it’s harder for others to detect our deceptions. We succeed because we don’t care about other people

---
Studies show that because people with self-compassion don’t beat themselves up, they have less fear of failure, which translates into less procrastination as well as more grit

---
BELIEVING IN YOURSELF IS NICE. FORGIVING YOURSELF IS BETTER

---
Feeling like number one means we don’t stress out about hurting others so we don’t experience stress when we fib.
 
---
Research has shown subjects with complete bilateral amygdala damage judge strangers to be much more approachable and trustworthy than normal people do.

---
Researchers think she might not even be capable of PTSD—no fear, no stress

---
But the twist is that as long as you’re past the 120 mark, many studies show more IQ points have little effect. What makes the difference? Not luck. It’s all those hours. 

---
Confidence is a result of success, not a cause. So in spite of my fevered recommendation of self-compassion, if you still want to focus on confidence, the surest path is to become really good at what you do.

---
The top 10 percent of workers produce 80 percent more than the average, and 700 percent more than the bottom 10 percent

---
People who were forgiving of themselves had the same areas light up that are activated when we care for other people. With romantic couples, self-compassion was evaluated as a better predictor of being a good partner than self-esteem.

---
 Research suggests that having this forgiving approach allows you to take more responsibility for problems while being less saddened by them

---
They saw themselves and the world more accurately but didn’t judge themselves as harshly when they failed.

---
Those who stayed very involved in meaningful careers and worked the hardest, lived the longest.” Meaningful work means doing something that’s (a) important to you and (b) something you’re good at

---
Signature strengths all day, every day. Of course you’d work long hours. Who’d want to go home?

---
The more hours per day Americans get to use their strengths to do what they do best, the less likely they are to report experiencing worry, stress, anger, sadness, or physical pain

---
Eran Shor, a professor at McGill University, found that being jobless increases premature mortality by a whopping 63 percent.

---
Burnout is the result of a pessimistic attitude toward your job. This isn’t getting me anywhere. I
can’t handle this. It’s never going to get any better.

---
We are always getting ready to live, but never living

---
Those mirrors are there because when we can stare at ourselves we pay less attention to how long the wait time is and complaints drop

---
People handle having lots of choices in two ways: by “maximizing” or “satisficing.” Maximizing is exploring all the options, weighing them, and trying to get the best. Satisficing is thinking about what you need and picking the first thing that fulfills those needs. Satisficing is living by “good enough.”

---
Without a plan, we do what’s passive and easy—not what is really fulfilling.

---
The loss of prefrontal function only occurs when we feel out of control. It’s the prefrontal cortex itself that is determining if we are in control or not. Even if we have the illusion that we are in control, our cognitive functions are preserved.” 

---
 Research shows we often don’t choose to do what really makes us happy; we choose what’s easy.

---
watching TV made teenagers truly happy 13 percent of the time. Hobbies scored 34 percent and sports or games got 44 percent

---
 Cal calls “deep work.” One hour when you will actually move things forward instead of just treading water

---
Distractions literally make you stupid. Students whose classroom was situated near a
noisy railroad line ended up academically a full year behind students with a quiet classroom

---
They had employers who gave them an environment free from distraction

---
As neuroscientist Daniel J. Levitin explains, when you’re concerned about something and your grey matter is afraid you may forget, it engages a cluster of brain regions referred to as the “rehearsal loop.” And you keep worrying and worrying. Writing your thoughts down and making a
plan for tomorrow switches this off.

---
Research shows that two and a half to four hours after waking is when your brain is sharpest. Do you want to waste that on a conference call or a staff meeting

---
It’s far better to engage in a hobby or spend time with friends

---
Cal Newport recommends a “shutdown ritual” in which you take the time to close out the day’s business and prepare for tomorrow. Research shows that writing down the things you need to take care of tomorrow can settle your brain and help you relax.

---
Make the things you should do twenty seconds easier to start and make the things you shouldn’t be doing twenty seconds harder. Sounds tiny but it makes a
big difference. By rearranging your workspace so temptations aren’t visible, you can trick yourself into making better choices.

---
Success is strange in that it cultivates more success. Once I had achieved something it encouraged me to try even harder. It expanded my perception of what was possible. If I could do this, then what else could I do

---
What any person in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn, if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.”

---
A network that helps you, and a job that leverages your natural introversion or extroversion. A level of confidence that keeps you going while learning and forgiving yourself for the inevitable failures. A balance between the big four that creates a well-rounded life with no regrets.

---
When you align your values with the employment of your signature skills in a
context that reinforces these same strengths, you create a powerful and emotionally engaging force for achievement, significance, happiness, and legacy. When your internal choice of success goals aligns with the group in which you operate, the rewards are even higher.

---
One word: alignment.Success is not the result of any single quality; it’s about alignment between who you are and where you choose to be. The right skill in the right role. A
good person surrounded by other good people.

---
It is better to give than to receive. Look for opportunities to do something for the other person, such as sharing knowledge or offering an introduction to someone that person might not know but would be interested in knowing.

---
We all have friends who are just cool to be around. They’re always sending you awesome stuff. “Hey, check out this book,” “Oh, you’ve got to see this video I just watched. Here, here’s a copy.” That is actually networking, because they’re serving you first.

---
Academic studies show that the biggest source of conflict between friends is making the time to see each other. Like we saw with Spencer Glendon, time is limited and valuable. Making time is the most fundamental way to show someone is important to you and that you care. So allocate an amount in advance to make sure networking goes from something you’d “like to do” to something that actually gets done. And there’s a lot of debate over whether or not money can really buy happiness, but research is conclusive in one area: money definitely brings happiness when we spend it on the people we love

---

How do you find alignment? As the Oracle at Delphi said so long ago, “Know thyself.” What are your intensifiers? Are you a Giver, a Taker or a Matcher? Are you more introverted or more extroverted? Underconfident or overconfident? Which of the big four do you naturally fulfill and which do you consistently neglect?

--- 

What’s the most important type of alignment? Being connected to a group of friends and loved ones who help you become the person you want to be. Financial success is great, but to have a successful life we need happiness. Career success doesn’t always make us happy, but the research shows that happiness does bring success.

--- 

How much money would it take to increase your happiness as much as a good social life does? Data from the Journal of Socio-Economics says you’d have to earn an extra $121,000 a year.

--- 

Valliant and his team scored the subjects in terms of their relationships at age forty-seven (how long had they been married, did they have kids, were they close to them, how many friends did they have). The results nearly matched how successful the men had been in their careers. The relationship score was like a crystal ball for how much money they made and how impressive their careers were. The men who scored highest made more than twice as much money as those who scored lowest. Was this effect and not cause? That’s unlikely. The guys who were the most empathic earned two and half times what the most narcissistic did.

“The only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people.”
