## Highlights
As the story goes, Ricard was in an fMRI scanner at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, being shown images of people in pain. He was told to tune in to his experience and just sit with the pain of witnessing another person suffering. (Essentially, he was asked to tap his empathy.) After doing this for a while, he is said to have begged the research team, “Can I please switch to compassion practice? This is getting too painful to bear.” Astonishingly, once he added compassion to his empathy, he found that he could continue witnessing others’ pain indefinitely—without the emotional overload.

Our favorite is “Wishing Your Loved Ones Well: Seated Practice,” a meditation created by Davidson’s nonprofit organization, Healthy Minds Innovation. It’s available in the Healthy Minds Program app, which is free, or as a free track on SoundCloud

Meanwhile, therapists report that sensitive people of all ages seem to make more progress and get more out of sessions. By adulthood, sensitive people can even end up being more resilient to stress than less-sensitive people are—the opposite of what most of us would expect.

---
 Sensitive people get a bigger boost from the same things that help anyone: a mentor, a healthy home, a positive group of friends. This boost allows them to do more and go further if they are given a nudge in the right direction. Sensitive people are built for supergrowth.

The theory of neurodiversity says that brain differences should not be considered deficits; rather, they are healthy variations on the spectrum of normal human traits. Sensitive people perceive

Consequently, many researchers accepted the link between the short SERT gene and depression as fact. But this conclusion didn’t sit well with Joan Chiao. As a neuroscientist, Chiao had come across data that suggested that people of East Asian descent—like herself—were much more likely to carry this gene variant. Nearly twice as likely, in fact

For you, a sensitive person, it’s the opposite: Your bucket fills quickly just from everyday activities, like a day at work or taking care of your kids at home. “Once the bucket is full,” explains Geleris, “it spills over and we see dysregulation or overstimulation. Essentially, it’s your sensory system saying, ‘Nope, no more. I have processed enough, I have filtered enough, I’m overworked, and I just don’t have the capacity to deal with it anymore.

---
Many gifted children, he found, carry on whole inner dialogues about their feelings—something not everyone does—and are so driven by compassion and human connection that emotions are simply a bigger concern for them

---
Calm can be as beautiful as action.

---
This finding may suggest that sensitive people don’t just experience the world differently but that they want different things out of life

---
Once compassion enters the picture, we do not necessarily experience other people’s pain with them, explains Singer, but we feel concern for them and a strong desire to help

While Kagan associated this temperament with fearfulness and worry, connecting it to the amygdala

In fact, a better word for sensitive might be responsive. If you are a sensitive person, your body and mind respond more to the world around you. You respond more to heartbreak, pain, and loss, but you also respond more to beauty, new ideas, and joy. You go deep where others only skim the surface. You keep thinking when others have given up and moved on to something else.

---
We ourselves become distressed and try to cope with our own response. Compassion is just the opposite…. We don’t get caught up in our own feelings and reactions. Our attention, infused with care and the motivation to help, is with the other person. Compassion is always—by definition—other-centered.” Compassion says, “What I’m feeling is beside the point. In this moment, it’s about you

---
Now I see my sensitivity as a blessing. I have a very rich and imaginative inner life. I’ve never been bored. I feel sorry for some of my friends who live their lives on the surface, never experiencing the deep, inner attunement to nature, the arts, and the universe in all its magnificent splendor. They do not ask the big questions about life and death. They talk about what they watched on TV or where they’re going next Sunday.

Later, two other scientists, Baldwin Way and Matthew Lieberman, came to a similar conclusion in 2010. In their study, they gave the short SERT variant a new name: the social sensitivity gene

Getting taken over by bigger, louder, and more aggressive personalities and, consequently, feeling resentment, hurt, or taken advantage of

Getting easily overwhelmed by arguments, raised voices, or other expressions of disappointment or anger (like a slammed door) and needing more time than others need to recover from conflict with loved ones

The Sensitive Person’s Relationship Dilemma

---
What if you truly are dealing with a high-conflict person, someone who frequently yells, twists the truth, or unfairly blames you? Bill Eddy of the High Conflict Institute defines high-conflict people as those with a pattern of behavior that increases conflict rather than reducing or resolving it. These people blame others for the problems they create themselves, engage in all-or-nothing thinking, aren’t in control of their emotions, and have extreme reactions to situations. You can’t control what a high-conflict person does, but you can work on learning to control how you respond (and you can decide how much of their behavior to allow in your life). If your friend or loved one is a high-conflict person, we recommend learning specific strategies to respond to them.

---
Sensitive people may also fall into the trap of expecting others to read their mind and anticipate their needs. It’s easy to see why: Sensitive people themselves excel at reading other people and anticipating others’ needs. However, if you’re a sensitive person, you may need to get comfortable being direct, perhaps more direct than you wish to be—even more so if you are in a relationship with a less-sensitive person. Don’t expect others to be able to read you as well as you can read them. Remember, you are different, and most people you meet will simply not possess your superpowers.

Narcissists believe they are superior to other people, although this attitude may show in subtle ways. They may, for example, ignore expert advice or be overly critical of the restaurant service. Narcissists lack empathy—even for their friends and family—and they believe they are entitled to attention, success, and special treatment

---
One way to instantly make conflict feel safer for sensitive people is to banish shouting, door-slamming, eye-rolling, insults, shame, intimidation, and other strong expressions of anger or disappointment from your relationships.

---
Here are some healthy ways to add more vulnerability to your relationships:
				
					Admit when something is hard, frustrating, or scary for you.
					Tell someone when you admire, respect, are attracted to, or love them.
					Be willing to share stories from your past, whether they were positive or negative experiences.
					Tell others when they have hurt you.
					Express your true feelings—even negative ones—rather than covering them up for the sake of politeness (sadness, frustration, disappointment, embarrassment, etc.).
					Share your opinion, even when you think others will disagree.
					Ask for help when you need it.
					Ask for what you want.

“It’s not a character defect; it’s not us trying to be difficult. I think that’s what my wife thought for a while. Being sensitive is a real personality trait. 

---
 Your child does not need to check every box to be considered sensitive, but the more boxes they check, the more sensitive they are.
				

---

				Without meaning to, adults often have a way of making children feel as if something is wrong with them. When it comes to sensitivity, they may see their child’s big emotions or tendency to get overwhelmed as bad.

---
Compared with other kids, a sensitive child is more likely to blame themselves for difficult situations

---
And as you probably already know, your sensitive child has a solid inner moral compass. Before they receive punishment or feedback, if they know they’ve potentially done something wrong, the chances are high that they’ve already punished themselves internally

---
their sense of shame is often so strong that they beat themselves up mentally for what they have done, and feel terrible without an adult saying a word to them

---
Sensitive kids are so receptive to a stern tone that they may feel shame just from hearing another kid being disciplined

---
Gentle discipline is about paying attention to what you say and how you say it. Raised voices can easily overwhelm a sensitive system
