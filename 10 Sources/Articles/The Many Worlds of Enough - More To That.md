Enough is elusive because when you reach it, you're no longer the person that once desired it.

Ambition is largely driven by self-actualization, or the desire to become a more capable person. And when this happens, it's only natural that good outcomes arise. You'll witness bumps in your reputation, be offered higher salaries, and so on. **But these things happen as a byproduct of your ambition, and not because these outcomes were your primary desires.**

But for the most part, **you've entered the domain of greed when you no longer pursue an endeavor because you're curious about it. It's when the coldness of utility replaces the warmth of curiosity.**

Do you really need to make more money to support your family, when what your family needs is your attention?

"You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough." You have to have your Worlds of Enough extend upward before realizing that this trend needs to be corrected. **After all, a minimalist is nothing more than a maximalist recovering from this epiphany.**
