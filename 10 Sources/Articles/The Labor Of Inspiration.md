Many creatives wait around for inspiration to show up to create. However the issue with this approach is how long will it take? One year, one month or one week.

**A laborer shows up to his job at a set time, works for a set number of hours, and does so for a set number of days each week.** Everything is mapped out in advance, and he simply needs to show up to get things in motion.

**From the perspective of the laborer, you create your own inspiration.**

It's much more enticing to go for a walk and read books than it is to sit and organize your thoughts onto a page.

**When you schedule creativity, you develop an expectation of yourself to produce something during that time. It doesn't have to be good, but there has to be something.**

I set a timer for ~2 hours each weekday morning, and use that time to write.

**Instead of mindlessly scrolling social media during your lunch break, you'll jot down ideas you want to build upon. This will allow you to regularly absorb inspiration from the outside, which you can then express through discipline from the inside.**
