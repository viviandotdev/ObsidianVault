- Since I couldn’t afford to hire a programmer, that meant I had to learn it myself. I went to the bookstore and got a book on PHP and MySQL programming. It was the slow road, but I loved it! Like being in the recording studio, it was wonderful to learn how to make the technology do what I wanted and not be a mystery. And it was nice to be self-sufficient.

- They said we were losing millions of dollars in business because we didn’t have certain features.

- When you want to learn how to do something yourself, most people won’t understand. They’ll assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way.
  But that’s forgetting about the joy of [[learning]] and doing.

- To be something (a good singer, a skilled entrepreneur, or just plain [[happy]]) is the real point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf7qdy28j54v89beg3fcen7b))

It's not that I wanted to get it done and have good vocals. It's that I wanted to be a great singer.

As the company grew, everyone was surprised that I still did all the [[programming]] myself. But for an online business, outsourcing the programming would be like a band outsourcing the songwriting!

When you want to learn how to do something yourself, most people won't understand. They'll assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way.

Yes, it may take longer. Yes, it may be inefficient. Yes, it may even cost you millions of dollars in lost opportunities because your business is growing slower because you're insisting on doing something yourself.

**But the whole point of doing anything is because it makes you [[happiness|happy]]!**

**In the end, it's about what you want to be, not what you want to have.**
