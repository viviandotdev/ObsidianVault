Behaviors that bypass our alarms about self indulgence, and are not even fun
- Doom scrolling is one of these behaviors that truly waste time and money
- I scroll because other people do it, but no one is looking at me and making sure I scroll so why do you do it?
- You don’t even talk about the things you see so what is point, you also don’t share anything you see so why scroll it is literally a time waster
- I think it gives me a dopamamine hit but all it does it waste my time,
- It like a nicotine

#### Highlights

> So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you'd asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by spending all their money. That's how it happens in books and movies, because that's the colorful way to do it.==**But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad [[investments]]**==

Wealth is usually lost not through spending on your money but on bad investments.

> It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking "wow, I'm spending a lot of money" ==Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an eye==

It is really difficult to spend a lot of money actually without think you are spending a lot of money and stop. However if you start trading options, you can lose millions of dollars in a single second.
This is because spending a lot of money requires a lot of decision making, with each purchase you are making a decision of whether to buy it or not. For extremely large purchases there are also nauturally checks in place to make sure you can afford it.

> spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn't. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms.==You're not spending the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another. ==Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say "it's an investment."

When you spend money alarms go off that don’t happen in investing, when you invest you are not spending money you are just moving it more one assets to other hoping the next assets will go up at a faster rate.

> The solution is to develop new alarms


> alarms that prevent you from overspending are so basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes fairly counterintuitive.


> The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. **When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent.**

It is okay to spend money having fun, you should enjoy the money you earn. However you should not spend time on doing fake work.

> **But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work.**

When doing fake work the alarms don’t go off when I get nothing done because the stuff seems like real work so you think you are being productive.
What is fake work?
- i think during work i pretend to do fake work because i have nothing to do and feel like I want to get something done.
- However doing fake work can be exhausting,

> the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they're not even fun.
