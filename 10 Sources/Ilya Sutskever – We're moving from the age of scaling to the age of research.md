**From 2020 until now we have been in the age of scaling**
- With the release of ChatGPT companies realized that scaling could lead to repeatable improvement
- However, research, tinkering is not guaranteed
**From no onward we are moving back to the age of research**
- No that the models 
- We have trained all these models on all the data in the world. Pre-training data is what makes these models today. Behind each model we have the same things because they are all trained on the same data anyway. To find novel solutions to AI we need to discover new methods 

**What are some new approaches to build AI?**
[[Continual learning]] as an definition for [[AGI]]
	A deployed learner that improves on the job is functionally super intelligent
	Humans generalize better and learn with far fewer samples due to evolution and build-in value functions.
Suppose we have two humans who want to be the best competitive programmer in the world
	programmer one, put's in 10,000 hours memorizes all the patterns and 

**How is [[reinforcement learning]] done naively**
- You have a neural net and give a problem to solve
- The modal has 1000s of actions to produce a solution
- You use a score to provider a training signal for every action in the trajectory
- **If you are training something that goes for a long time the agent will not do any learning until the problem is solved**
	- In the [[Deep Seek R1]], the space of trajectories is so wide that is makes it difficult to learn a mapping from an intermediate trajectory and value.


Continual learnin
[[Value function]] -> give intermediate feedback so agents can learn faster.
**What are value functions?t**
- In terms of AI value functions determine the current state of an decision?
- They evaluate how well the agent is performing and guide it towards making decisions that maximize future rewards. 
- Examples of chess->
	- We can compute the evaluation functions on all possible positions from this current position and then make a decision based on the best score on the [[Value function]]
